Escape from the Planet of the Apes is second only to the original in critical praise. For this, I am baffled. It is not the worst of the bunch. That would be tomorrow’s installment. But the continuity errors and silly attempt to place Cornelius and Zira into modern society was just too much for me. It is just too much of a radical departure from the previous films for me to get behind.
Call me a skeptic, but I rather doubt she really spent time in the presence of God. Why? Well, in scripture, when people find themselves in the presence of God, they are overwhelmed not with tranquility, but with terror. Isn't that what we've been coming across in our reading in Exodus? As Israel camped at the foot of Mt. Sinai, God made his presence known on the mountain—
I realized how much I have struggled to let it be-and judged myself instantly when I could not: my whole story depends on judgment.
The act also established a decimal system of currency for the country and set the various denominations of the coins. The three highest value coins were all made from gold: $10 Eagles, $5 Half Eagles, and $2.50 Quarter Eagles. Next came five silver coins: $1 Dollars or Units, $0.50 Half Dollars, $0.25 Quarter Dollars, $0.10 Dismes, and $0.05 Half Dismes. The $0.01 Cent and $0.005 Half Cent were to be made from copper.
Whisk cooled butter, cream cheese, sugars, salt and flavorings together until smooth. Let rest 2-3 minutes. Add egg and whisk until combined. Mix in the flour and baking soda with a spatula, just till combined. Stir in chocolate chips and nuts. Cover dough and refrigerate overnight or for 48 hours, if preferred. When ready to bake, heat oven to 375F and line baking trays with parchment. Using about 2-1/2 – 3 Tbsp. dough, make balls, then flatten between palms and place on baking sheet. Sprinkle with sea salt. Bake 8 minutes, till set but not brown; cool completely, about 15 minutes. Bake again 8-9 minutes, till lightly browned. Cool in pans 5 minutes, then turn out onto wire racks to finish cooling.

I decided to finish my degree as at this time I was getting quite unwell again (the start of my current ongoing BPD crisis, still pre-diagnosis) as I had nearly 700 credits with the OU and although I needed to do one more course to get the BSc Hons in Health Studies I no longer wanted to study health related courses for the time being, so I cashed in 360 of my credits for an unnamed 2.1 Bsc Hons… I had my graduation ceremony in June 2010, but due to the course counted for the degree I had actually ‘graduated’ in December 2008…

Wars are alternately galvanizing and divisive events. One, of course, wants the home team to do well, to fight with honor and to come home safely. To do that, other people must die, many of them innocents. Many, sadly, are children. But they’re not our children so our grief is not long lasting. We move on to other things – celebrity weddings and all of that.

Turn your attention to the recent explosion of self-promoted success in the digital music, film, and book markets. There is a growing movement of musicians, filmmakers, and writers who are forging new ways to make a living producing their art – and they are doing it without obnoxious marketing and the corporate superstructure responsible for such marketing. These artists are connecting directly with fans and giving their fans a reason to buy. The most successful new wave of artist success stories is powered by this emergent ethos. Be yourself, address your fans directly. We’re all people, and we can buy from each other, without gatekeeping from corporations posing as people.

However, they are not allowed to wear jeans and a raggedy old t-shirt to church. I will let them help me plan meals and then help make dinner. But dinner can not consist of jelly beans, potato chips and hot chocolate.

We were saving our appetites for dinner at Chad's. We invited my friend that took me back and forth to the hospital all those days. She brought him a box of chocolate truffles. I did bring the camera, but forgot to take pictures. The service was excellent. We'll just have to go back again and remember to take pictures. They have a prime rib sandwich on garlic bread for lunch. We were too full for dessert. Another reason to go back.
Blake is moving on to Europe for two weeks out of a desire to attend a French DIY waxing course and to learn how to make decent sauerkraut, from what I understand. I would have solemnly pointed out that he will always be inherently, impossibly hairy and no one can ever make sauerkraut taste good, but I’m not one to crush dreams. From there he’ll be in Madrid – BLAKE GO TO THE FUCKING PRADO – where he’ll partake in World Youth Day, an event whose purpose and MO still escapes me even after dozens of explanations – and visit the wonderful Prado Museum on the side, Squeaky Robot’s favorite. As you can see, it’s an exciting time for him! I can’t wait to become hopelessly envious over all the stunning photography he produces; I also can’t wait to laugh maniacally when the cheapest guy in the world starves to death in Western Europe solely due to his absurdly erroneous habit of comparing all of the world’s prices to those in Southeast Asia and subsequently rejecting them. Don’t worry, Blakey, leaves are free and high in fiber.

While I'm sure all the stories are great, I already have a favorite. Diana Peterfreund shared with me an early draft of her story, "Foundlings" and I just ate it up. I don't want to give too much away, but it deals with teen pregnancy in a world that's not all that far removed from our own. You know how some dystopian stories are set in these crazy societies that you just know could never really exist here on Earth? Well, Diana's setting feels eerily plausible, especially after reading some recent headlines. Even more so, since I first read it when I was pregnant myself, last year. Scary stuff! But, like, in a good, entertaining kind of way!

But differences persist on rank determination. The Maoists have demanded at least a Brigadier General position for one of their commanders. The opposition parties and the NA have said they cannot give anything higher than the rank of a Major as this would hamper the “professionalism” of the army, and cause resentment among serving officers.
Pushkin’s Tatiana
She keeps insisting that the deed restoring the place to her be drafted to her specifications and she won't accept the perfectly good deed we give her. We point out that her format isn't recordable....she still demands it. We acquiesce and hey, what do you know, its not recordable. She then demands another one. We draft one that will work and she then makes a number of ridiculous demands such as requiring that it have a gold and raised seal on it (totally unnecessary in Michigan) and makes other weird claims. We send her the deed via signature delivery and tell her that third times the charm and that's it, she can record it, she can hang it on her wall, she can roll it and smoke it, whatever but we're done playing around. We also send directly to the county a release of the original lien, which the county takes over a month to record.
We have, at best, a dodgy internet provider (I’m pretty sure they’re just a bunch of DoDo’s). We are left without access just as often as we are left with it. And I always find myself left kind of at a loose end when I know I can’t get online and I start to get antsy.

How can you ever, ever repay anyone for a gift like that? Giving this child life and handing them over for someone else to raise, in my eyes, is the most unselfish act that any woman can ever make. There just aren't enough thank you's in the world that could scratch the surface of how you want to express what it means for you to be given the opportunity to be called "Mama".
Now, let me clarify something here. I’m not saying God is the cause for our hardship in life. No, that’s not what I’m saying. Sin is the cause of these things. But if we are obedient, if we stay obedient to God, then God can use the bad things in this life and turn them into times of growth for us. He gives the cloud a silver lining, so to speak, and makes sure we don’t endure without there being something we can gain from the trials in life.
The stores were graded on a number of factors, including the sale of overfished species such as Chilean sea bass, hoki, orange roughy, and shark. The retailers were also scored based on the degree to which their fishing methods were destructive to habitat and the environment, as well as on their conservation initiatives, transparency and internal policies.
The weary old model of agencies charging for time places an undue emphasis on stretching out the strategic and creative development process for as long as possible.

Russ: “The writer whom I credit with the Thingness of Things more than anyone is Anton Chekhov, who is my current main squeeze. He just does it, he can talk about the moonlight on the ocean, the smell of the trees and flowers in a garden which transcends mere description – he gets right to the thingness of things. It can’t be learnt. You’ve either got it or you haven’t. If you’ve got it, flaunt it.”
The Bible tells us of Father Abraham, who “being not weak in faith, considered not his body now dead, when he was about a hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sara’s womb: He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God” (Romans 4:19-20). Abraham tangibly expressed his hope by giving praise to god; he didn’t allow his physical condition to discourage him. If there’s no substance or tangible expression to your hope, then there is no faith.

I see that twelve cities in the UK are going to vote today in a referendum on whether to have a celebrity mayor… Which is odd because in Bury, a lowly town, we had that referendum in 2008 showing that we’re ahead of the trend. The million pound mayor was what they called it after “interested parties” pushed a referendum through and the same “interested parties” were quite surprised when commonsense local folk told them, in ballot form, to buggar off.

I paid off my credit card debt this spring/summer and today I made my final payment to my brother. Several years ago, my oldest brother helped me purchase a used car. I had been in an accident where my car was totaled by an uninsured driver and since I had "liability only" coverage, most of the costs weren't covered. My brother was completely amazing and loaned me a little over $2,000 to help me buy a new car. Today, I transferred the final amount owed to him.

Gillian is also really good at spotting mushrooms, probably due to her closeness to the forest floor. All mushrooms should be cooked before consuming them, so she knows to never put any mushroom in her mouth. She has a favorite wild mushroom (sulphur shelf) to eat, and can identify several other species already. We used to have a monetary incentive of a quarter for every mushroom she spots, and while it helped fill our basket, it also quickly emptied our pockets. We still try to make mushroom hunting fun by bringing a magnifying glass with us to examine some of the fungi we find. Get your kids outside, and show them a few cool mushrooms, even if they are not edible.

And then, stillness, as if all momentum is lost. Her breath returns and she finds herself gasping painfully. Opening her eyes, she finds herself kneeling on the floor, with no blood or broken bones to mark her fall. Mystified, she slowly drags herself to her feet and looks at the space before her. She is standing in a room covered in curving slabs of raw sienna and burnt umber, smooth and spare, with large shapes patterned into overlapping forms along the wide expanse of wall. The ceiling is a uniform misty red, as of gases swirling above a transparent convex barrier. Brief flickers and sparks glow and ripple through the gases, and the effect is so hypnotic and calming that she almost fails to hear the sound of a throat clearing behind her.

…I’m a biker. Well, I’m not a biker of the Harley or BMW variety. I guess I should say I am a cyclist. Yes, that’s better- I cycle quite a bit to get from here to there and mostly because I enjoy it. I don’t do much nighttime cycling even though I have all the right equipment to do so(lights,reflective gear, etc.). I prefer to be out on my bike early mornings. Of course this means that at certain times of the year it will actually be dark when I head out for a spin.

Sometimes it's hard to remember that Boston Beer Company/Samuel Adams is still a craft beer company because their reach in the market is so widespread. But at 2.4 million barrels in 2011, they are certainly well under the 6 million barrel production limit that defines a craft brewery. Much like New Belgium and Sierra Nevada, it's great to see Samuel Adams, a well-established craft beer brewer, still trying new things. With their new bomber series, BBC is experimenting with new styles like barleywine, rauchbier and chili bock. And while they might not be for everyone, we should appreciate the fact they are staying progressive in a time when consumers are craving variety and innovation in craft beer styles.

For many people it is easy to blame capitalism for our current economic environment. The truth is capitalism is not evil and it’s not what caused this economic crisis. What caused this financial mess are the people who immorally and unethically used the free enterprise system for their own benefit without regard for who they would get hurt in the process. So don’t blame the system. Blame those who hijacked the system for their own devious pleasures.

Even main characters need to have a balance of both good and bad. Having flaws creates characters that are real, likable, and relatable. In the series Fablehaven by Brandon Mull, a main character named Seth has a fatal flaw making him fail at nearly everything he attempts. Getting behind someone who messes everything up over and over can get nerve racking. But, in the end you cheer for him. Why is that? What makes him so likable? Is it that we all can relate to screwing things up more than once?

Working from her faculty studio at Green Mountain College in Poultney, Vermont, Karen Swyler employs what can be described as a thematic approach to her ceramic work. Concentrating on personal relationships and memory, her pieces rely on juxtaposition to one another to be complete both in concept and form. Swyler’s work is clearly grounded in the history of ceramics and the vessel, but through cutting and altering her thrown forms, much of Swyler’s work enters the realm of the sculptural. Her vessels act as metaphoric memoirs--as bodies relating to one another through proximity, palette, line and contour.

The Spadina Expressway battle was a watershed moment in the civic life of Toronto. It made heroes of people like Jane Jacobs and the late Colin Vaughn. It emboldened others from the struggle to do still more. They include some of the Toronto School Board trustees who brought in heritage language programs and a host of other progressive reforms that Harrisites haven't been able to completely dismantle. The Spadina struggle made way for the famous "reform councils" at Toronto City Hall, councils that saved and strengthened the neighbourhood character of the city and developed world-renowned programs such as the Healthy City model.
So, I am back on Weight Watchers as of 5 minutes ago. Starting tomorrow I will be keeping track of what I eat and weighing myself every Monday (since weight loss fairies don't exist I will not be weighing myself tomorrow because there will be no change overnight). The other thing I love about Weight Watchers is they give you a healthy goal range. Per them, my healthy range is 102-128. I picked 113 as my goal because it is in the middle.

I shall not bother to ponder over how many people had heard of a certain Vladimir Ulyanov before 1917 or even during that momentous year until the very end of it. Let us merely think about how widely our own politicians, who have all the access to the media they could desire, are known.

But my point is the simple one of 'Why didn't I know about her?' Maybe I am alone in my ignorance but I think it is more likely that we forget too quickly the female pioneers who chip away at the glass ceiling for the rest of us. With no Ellen, no Maggie! Hmm. Perhaps this would be a good role for the next Oscar winning film? I'd cast Kate Winslet but only if she promised not to weep buckets when she won the prize - Ellen would not approve.
Now, surprise surprise, the Jewish Eskenazis still owe Repsol billions for shares which they were assigned but have not paid for, but the so-called patriotic Argentine government has insisted that the Eskenazis will retain their stake; the only shares that are to be confiscated are Repsol's. So to cut a long story short the Spaniards are being doubly screwed by Jews. Their own shares, for which they paid many billions, investing many billions more over the years to restore YPF to profitability have been stolen; they will be lucky to get ten cents in the dollar in compensation in the corrupt Jew-run Argentine courts. But to add insult to injury, shares which they also effectively paid for, and which they were forced to cede to the Eskenazis and for which they now will never be paid, have been ring-fenced for the Jewish swindlers who obviously hatched this plan with Kirchner for their own benefit. The Eskenazis will keep a 25 per cent stake for which they have paid practically nothing. Kirchner and her cronies will no doubt get a hefty commission.

The Fiend will shy away from flame and not fight any character who bares a torch. It also hates sunlight, as this turns it into inanimate stone until the New Moon. If the characters prevent it from hiding back in the barrow, it will seek a sheltered spot where it's body can lie undisturbed during the next month, such as the bottom of a deep stream. If it does get back into the barrow it can be killed by lighting a huge fire that covers the entire mound, as this cooks it against the hot stones.

I think what drew my attention to this argument was the principle that if you have no children, you have no place to give advice. This worries me a bit. I have been studying a BA in Children's and Family Work, on the job, for the last 3 years (with another year in the job before that) so that I can be an effective Children's and Families Worker in my church. I have also spent time with Sure Start attending various parenting groups and engaging in conversation with mothers there. Part of my role in both these places is to use my training and experience to give advice and answer questions. Even if that means saying, "I have no idea, but let me find you someone who does!" My long term plan is to perhaps work for an organisation such as Sure Start providing family support for parents of children aged 0-5. It's what I have been training to do.

The Poet Walt Whitman said, “Every moment of light and dark is a miracle.” He was right! Everything is a miracle, a gift from God and the moment we rediscover and embrace this truth the smoother life will be. I am not saying that is easy or we should be happy when we are in pain or darkness has over taken us. That would be dumb and you should ignore me. I know life can be hard, harsh, and terrible. Often it seems life is suffering. Evil things happen. Chaos ensues. Yet, I don’t think dwelling on the bad will ever make us feel better. We are called to serve our neighbor, to speak truth in tragedy, and to do good. If we dwell on the bad that is flung at us than we cripple ourselves from serving, speaking, and doing good, but if we can step beyond our little selves than we can do good.

We then catch up with Richie arguing with his wife, Laurie (Carla Gugino) because she wants to move to Las Vegas, bringing their kid, Michael, along with her. He claims Vegas isn't a good environment to raise a kid and she argues that having the kid around him and his friends isn't any better. Their argument is interrupted by some teenagers breaking glass after Richie asked them to "be cool." He takes a break and threatens to shoot them if they don't settle down and pick up the glass they broke. Laurie points out that he doesn't have a gun afterwards and remarks affectionately. "You're crazy, Richie." and then tells him she'll see him in court. He tells his son he'll see him next week and Laurie takes off. Richie gets to his apartment and studies his law books. and takes a test later on at school.

We give lots of lip service to the importance of education, but look at what has happened to education within the past five years. We have enacted a national plan to evaluate the effectiveness of all teachers based solely on the scores their students achieve on simplistic standardized tests, and ignoring all other factors. The Wisconsin governor ignited a firestorm of nasty name-calling focused on public school teachers, in the service of saving money, and hundreds of thousands of our best teachers nationwide took the occasion to retire early or get into a new line of work where their efforts are appreciated. Support for essential education is at the lowest level in decades. America will be the worse for it.

The following day, just below San Juan Hill in eastern Cuba, a bulldozer rumbled to a start, clanked into position, and started pushing dirt into a huge pit with blood pooling at the bottom from the still-twitching bodies of more than a hundred men and boys who'd been machine-gunned without trial on the Castro brothers' orders. Their wives and mothers wept hysterically from a nearby road. On that very day, the U.K. Observer ran the following headline: "Mr. Castro's bearded, youthful figure has become a symbol of Latin America's rejection of brutality and lying. Every sign is that he will reject personal rule and violence."

Kade had a really high fever last week that would not go down no matter what we did. We took him to the dr and of course they take your money and do nothing but tell you to wait it out for a week to 1o days ( fun eh?) So after 7 days of a high fever I went and got blood work done... They think that Kade had a virus that just kicked his trash because his white blood cell count was way below what it should've been. They called me with the test results at 9:30 at night and wanted to see him because they were so worried. Of course I freaked out and have been on pins and needles since trying to figure out if it was in fact just a virus. My poor baby has had to have 2 antibiotic shots and his blood drawn 3 times. All of which I had to be a part of and actually hold him down. Watching my baby scream and cry and stare me in the eyes and wonder why I am allowing people to hurt him is the hardest thing in the world. It just breaks my heart to think about it. But even though I know it is for his own good, It still doesn't make me feel much better:( He is feeling better and actually playing and eating and all that good stuff, and it is nice to see! I missed my little monster running all over and making noise. All he did was sleep and want to be held. Although I didn't mind the cuddling:) Being a mom is the greatest, hardest, best thing that I have ever done and I wouldn't trade it for anything! Shout out to all the mommies out there that can relate!

On a plate, put the cornmeal and season it with paprika and parsley. Using 2 large spoons or your hands (which I prefer), roll the mixture into good-sized balls. I got 14 balls out of the mixture but you can make them larger for big cakes or smaller for hors d'ouvres. Flatten the balls into patties and coat lightly with the corn meal. Heat a large skillet with oil and in 3 batches, fry the patties, about 4 minutes each side, until they are golden brown and crispy. Put on a paper towel to drain and sprinkle some salt on them. Serve while hot.

Sunday I was honored by a snake guardian. As Jeff planted and watered, I was fixated on one particular bud on one of our mum plants. It was small and far too early for its blooming. So I moved around at a different angle that put me further from the bud I was staring at. I found myself gazing at a blank spot on the ground in front of them and that is when the snake appeared. It slithered over that spot and into the mums. Immediately my higher self assured me this snake needed to be there, that he was a guardian. This isn’t the first time I’ve been faced with one of my animal totems and certainly not my first time with the snake. When I was in my mid-teens my parents decided to move out from the big city so they could have livestock and a farm. The first house we moved into, had it’s own waterfall that was so huge you could drive a car under it and the property butted up against a National Forest. I spent a lot of summer days with friends in the hollow of that waterfall and had many experiences with wild life there. But, it wasn’t at the waterfall that I met with snake, it was closer to home. I was outside poking around, watching the birds when suddenly a small rattlesnake was in front of me. He hooded up like a cobra, which sort of freaked me out, yet I was mezmorized by him and stood perfectly still as he swayed and occasionally swiped at me, just far enough to miss. I had just moved from a completely different lifestyle and so major transformations were taking place.

While getting my bike fit, we got into a discussion about my other disciplines. After hearing that my run times(I recently clocked a 7 mi run @ 6:46 min/mile), Chip was shocked to hear my swim time(usually about 2:20 ish min/100 yd pace). He thought that with my level of fitness I should be able to swim at a 1:30-1:45 min/100 yd pace; I just needed some technique help! Hearing this gave me some extra motivation and with a little work on my form by myself I managed to get some times between 2:00 and 2:10 min/100 yd pace. After this I went in for the swim analysis, and like the bike, the results were amazing!!! We did a lot of corrections to my technique! During my first swim after the analysis I did a 500 yd swim in 9 min 27 sec; my previous best time was 10 min 53 sec!!!! Once again, this is a time I didn’t expect to hit for quite some time!!! I was able to focus on a lot of the corrections during this swim, but there’s still more work to be done, which means that my times will be dropping even more!!!!

Edward Scissorhands, in Burton’s version, remains incredibly poignant not because of its contemporary symbols (actually the goth look of Edward now feels quite dated) but because the story is an update of various tragedies and myths. The most notable and the oldest is the story of the Greek God Hephaestos, who fell from Mount Olympus and ended up bringing man the skills they needed to build civilization. Edward and Hephaestos are very similar. Both are lame in the eyes of society yet bring the gifts that enable society to actualize its potential. Edward brings fresh innovations and dazzling effect to ordinary things like hairstyles, hedge trimming, and dog grooming. He becomes famous for this, a media darling. Like Hephaestos, he was sought for his skills by both the ordinary and the heroic.

This is just to let you know that my short story, ‘The Visit’, recently shortlisted in the UK for the Wasafiri Prize for New Writing, was announced winner at a ceremony last week in Somerset House, London. I won joint first prize with another shortlisted writer, Jayne Ryan, and was presented with cheque by Fiction judge, Romesh Gunesekera (nominated in 1995 for the Booker Prize for his novel, Reef). Wasafiri is Britain’s premier magazine for international contemporary writing. Published quarterly, it has established a distinctive reputation for promoting work by new and established voices across the globe. The 2010 Summer issue of the magazine was dedicated to Ireland: Texts and Contexts and featured articles by Declan Kiberd and Alain Chouinard. ‘The Visit’ is set against the backdrop of Bill Clinton’s visit to Dundalk in 2000 and will appear in the March issue of Wasafiri.
Maternity clothes? Yep and LOVE them! I don't know why we need to wait til pregnancy to wear these wonderful things! For Christmas, Rick & Mel got me a gift card to Pea in the Pod.

So this weekend I went back out and finished up my Maternity wardrobe at Motherhood. They have equally super cute things with about 1/2 the price! I also got a few new bras...kinda had a freak out moment when the sweet lady working there told me how big my boobs will probably get!

I remember a huge debate that rocked our home when my FIL decided to build a temple in his ancestral village and a room at Badri Kedar . The question which we raised was “whose temple is it anyway, yours or God’s”? It was funny to me but to the family it struck like a bolt of thunder. It also sparked another fire when I asked how a family can fast for seven days, chant bhajans in praise of the goddess, light a lamp twice a day and abuse , insult the DIL of the house ? Does the Devi grant permission for that? The question evokes responses which the Goddess herself is still wondering about but her devotees have forgotten conveniently.

We could also take a look at the animal kingdom. Almost every species of sexually reproducing, multi-gender animal has been observed to engage in some degree of homosexual activity. There are scientists who spend their lives trying to work out why. Assuming that homosexuality is unnatural, why is so much of nature engaging in it? Accepted, this doesn’t necessarily apply to humans. For example, rabbits eat their own dung. But then most animals don’t eat their own droppings, so humans are hardly unusual in this respect.

“The last two decades have seen a "… cumulative disinvestment in publicly funded programmes resulting from the withdrawal of the health departments of provincial governments from this sector, the absence of discounts for research tests from the business model for the National Health Laboratory Service, chronic underfunding of the Medical Research Council ... and the lack of funding streams to universities that might in principle have been applied to meet the overall shortfall in support.

That’s a Martha Stewart original, by the way. I’ve decided she must have a serious thing for Halloween. Every year, she has a special Halloween issue with a picture of her in an exceedingly cool costume on the front. She’s even published a book on decorating for Halloween. This year, her magazine has instructions for making a really good kids’ mummy costume using stained paper towels around the face. As good as you can get without getting into latex and professional techniques, I think (I hope me thinking it counts for something, since I graduated with an emphasis in theatrical makeup!). Overall, I think Martha Stewart Halloween stuff = really really cool.
Alternately, if you're a nerd (I mean, a REAL nerd) your method of suicide can be even easier. All you have to do is watch some Star Wars porn and slowly feel how you die on the inside.
Slipping back out of his tunnel, Xu Guan paused and listened. All was quiet except for the sounds of birds singing in nearby trees. Xu Guan took the time to haul away his dirt pile and toss it onto the muddy banks of the nearby creek that ran through the woods.
Just a post to let you guys know I'm still alive - it's been wicked hot here in Southern Ontario and I've had about a weeks worth of sun stroke and let me tell you - it's not fun.
Well as you can see we are off to California again today and I can't sleep. We get to see Caшa, Лука, our grandsons, but that is the only blessing. We are very tired of making this trip and have looked for almost any reason this time, to postpone it, however, we have to go and get this move behind us.
But like the toys on top of the spilled juice on top of the crumbled leaves, it’s one layer at a time; one layer removed to expose the next, removed to expose the next, and so on until the carpet sparkles like Becky’s.
It was a great pleasure to watch the EW distance runners in action. At the time of this blog, Coach McLain has churned out a 1600 meter factory. Senior Juan Blanco leads the way with a blazing 4:19.6 (breaking his own school record), Junior Elias Leija Garza is at 4:32 and super freshman Brian Casillas at 4:37. Throw in a slab of guys in the 4:50 area (Luis Salazar, Alex Blanco, Caleb Buntyn, Steven Rios and Steven Wallace) and the potential for a great 4 x 1600 squad in the post season exists. Getting one of the last group of guys down under 4:40 and the potential is there for a sub 18. Post season EW kids?? With EW's great ability in the sprint relays, the making is definitely there for a blazing distance medley. Would be interesting to see. The talent and coaching is definitely there.
Rowena did not have a chance to figure out a way around that sword or the young man holding it. She was lifted off the floor from behind, and Warrick commanded, "Put that away, Bernard, and go and wake the cook." But the moment the boy had left to do as bidden, the hard voice turned softly menacing to whisper in her ear, "If you had not earned a punishment before, wench, you have now—but first I must feed you."

1. citybuoy - I was impressed by the unpretentiousness of his posts, coupled with excellent writing skills. A rare combination, indeed. Also, smart boys have a special appeal for me, and Nyl already knows - or if he doesn't yet, he sure hell knows now - that I would like to fuck his brains out.

5. Ataturk was the first leader of "modern" Turkey, sometime after World War I. He was known as a "reformer," which I think simply means that he tried to get Turkey to be more "Western" and secular in outlook (and I vaguely remember that one of the "reforms" was encouraging Turks to wear Western hats, not fezzes; I think there was actually a "Hat Law." Apparently, he did not think fezzes were cool).
At any rate, this is my farewell post. Thanks for keeping up with the chaos that was my classroom. Best wishes to you all!

Four are basically irrefutable, and the fifth spot, obviously, runs a rough spot. The default pick is Mirren, but of course Blunt or Ronan (or Laurent or Cotillard, though they were probably fucked out of the race completely thanks to the category fluctuation - THANKS HARV) could make it in. Mirren seems pretty fun tho? So whatever.

I come in gratitude for the richness, the diversity, the great abundance of unique souls in this world. Thank you for the very complexity that distinguishes each one of us. May all people find those who will love and accept them, will value their distinctive beauty and spirits. May we each feel the presence of your transcending mystery, may we know that we are part of a process of life that is rooted in divine, emanating love, and may we feel the comfort of knowing that every one of us is cherished by God.

And I am not just vying for your attention. (OK...maybe a little bit!) I am a MESS today! So, yesterday afternoon we were all outside - all 5 of us. The big kids were playing hide and seek with the neighbor girls and our little guy was just running behind everyone trying to look like her knew what he was doing. It was sweet and they tolerated him! Then he got bored and was riding his big wheel. I decided I was going to throw all caution to the wind and tell him I would race him. I try not to run in front of anyone older than 6 but I was in one of "those" moods. I didn't care.
So the thought of WR holder Bolt taking on the up and coming Dix on what has become 200 meter Mecca was like visions of sugar plums dancing in my head. But it would appear that upon Dix’ completion of his race in Eugene, he joined the ranks of the truly elite, and now the Big 3 (Bolt, Gay, Powell) has become a Big 4. At least it looks that way, because the Big 3 don’t race often and Dix now seems to be one to avoid judging by the events of the days since Pre.

I recently finished up speaking around 45 minutes at Rowan University. It was for their chapter in the National Wellness Institute (NWI) group where approximately 20 or so students showed up. I was surprised at how well it went considering at the beginning I almost crapped myself (we could not log on to use the powerpoint slides so I was just going to have to wing it). The Powerpoint presentation I created was my opinion on information that I thought would apply some form of practical information for those possibly interested in strength &conditioning/athletic development etc… Basically, it was my opinion on what the role of the strength coach is and our philosophy (joint by joint approach). I understand there are many overlapping systems that can be more thoroughly understood by reading Kevin’s blog on regional interdependence. We actually were able to get the powerpoint fired up and it went better then expected. This was something that I think needs to be understood from almost all trainers in whatever field and something that I have learned from reading the likes of Mike Boyle, Kevin, and other leading strength coaches in the field.

I've never found a brewery called Pattinson. The closest I've come is the Edinburgh firm of Pattison. Just one letter difference. Not such a big deal. Their story, albeit brief, tells us much about the opportunities and pitfalls of the beer trade in the 1890's.
Other planning includes potentially moving to a different house. Again – this will be positive to have all the kids in one school district. To be closer to friends and church. And to start a new chapter in our lives without the haunting memories always in front of us. There will be a bittersweetness involved, but underlying it is a forward-looking hope.

Ah! Now, if you haven't read the comments you have to, both for 24/3 and last week, as it seems Brendon's bassist Dave Levy, as WeddingSuit, has joined the conversation with his insight into recording, including that script PDF up there. This week he's brought out the big stuff, a double-necked instrument. Brendon's brought his own acoustic with him, slinging it behind his back to begin like a wayfaring stranger, while one of the guitarists is sporting a Rubettes cap. Well, they didn't need them any more. Must be said, while this never got beyond number 14 the crowd are as into it as the producer evidently was, clapping the off-beat throughout and not minding when the cameraman takes several of them down at once judging by the size of the wobble.

Even though it goes against 100's of years of Irish tradition we did plant some spuds in old tyres this year!

So, I can’t help but ask: how many climaxes? Is there a certain formula that works for most stories. Or does each story need to be taken on a case-by-case basis? I know certain things don’t work. I don’t like books that don’t have a true climax or only have one real climax. Is there a limit to how many? If so, what is the range? I’m going to be thinking about this one in the months ahead as I continue to read random books. Anyone have any ideas?

On this particular day, I’d woken up and prepared to be specifically focused on the trafficking issues of Cambodia. I headed out to the river front of Phnom Penh where our team had decided to see with our own eyes what the blackest part of injustice looked like. While sitting on the bench near the river, my eyes focused and ready to confront all the white middle aged men with younger than 18 year old Cambodian girls, my mouth suddenly became glued and my heart broke in half at what I saw…

Well, I tried to wear this outfit, but I was foiled again by our unseasonably warm weather. No sooner had I taken the photos than I was starting to sweat, so the vest had to go. Sigh.

47. The memoir of Erica Kane from All My Children (Yes a memoir of a fictitious character exists)
This Italian/American horror/thriller shows a definite nod to the classics of directors like Dario Argento, as it's less about brutish blood and gore and more about what's going on in the heads of the characters. Veteran actor Domiziano Arcangeli stars as Sebastian, a lonely and reclusive artist who reluctantly meets his stunning and alluring neighbor, Sarah Roeg (played by the amazing Irena Hoffman). She soon takes an unusual interest in him and his odd lifestyle and photography.

"Personally, I have always considered malt flavour a most important characteristic of first-class ale, both pale and mild, but of late years the increased demand for low gravity pale-coloured ales has greatly reduced the sale of full malt-flavoured ales. Pale malts being in such demand, the maltster is afraid to fire his malt high enough to develop much flavour, and consequently most of the pale ale of the present day lacks the delicate malt flavour which only a fair amount of firing, as distinct from curing, will produce.
This year, I was assigned to watch an action film called Deadly Prey (1987). You can tell this is from the 1980s right from the get-go with a wide shot of a silhouetted figure running up a hill and pumping a gun in the air, which leads into an opening-credits sequence that intercuts title cards with shots of all manner of weapons being loaded one at a time.

If you like paranormal stories and haven’t started this series yet, now is the time. The Grim Reaper Charley Davidson is back with just as much bite and snarky humor as ever. She’s not the usual grim reaper with the black hood and scythe and all, but one hot, badass chick with sarcasm oozing out of every pore. Her friends and coworkers are just as amusing as in the first two reads and even the nun…yeah, the nun, was pretty amusing! This is the first time I’ve listened to an audiobook of the series and I feel that Lorelei King did a great job at portraying all of the different characters. There is some heat to this series as well, and it doesn’t let up in this third book. Charley and Reyes are still hot and heavy and Cookie is still trying to live vicariously through Charley’s stories. There is no lack of action, if anything there might be more within this read. I can’t wait for the fourth book, Fourth Grave Beneath My Feet or the start of her new YA series Death and the Girl Next Door.

Many have told me that the worship of the heathen gods seems a bit arbitrary for me, and in many ways, it is. I have no need for the Viking manly warrior thing, as I have said many times. And it is difficult to get past that, even in my own better-informed brain. It is often difficult to get information out of the conscious and into the subconscious, and the fact that the heathens were not always war-mongering is a hard one for me. Plus, my ancestors are only third-most Germanic. They are mostly Irish (on my Father’s side) and some undocumented Native American (illegitimate through my mother’s side). So the ancestor argument is out for me.

This recipe has been all over Pinterest and with good reason. It's so easy and it is cheesy and delicious. The bacon may seem like overkill to those who don't worship at that shrine (I can't envision a food that can't be made better with bacon). I did find, however, that the cooking time was way off and I believe the dish can be made simpler still by using a mandolin to slice the potatoes very thinly and omitting the parboiling, which I intend to do next time. Therefore, I'm editing the instructions to reflect this. Otherwise, you want to try this dish very soon.

I took Larry's weird vine off of the trellis, and collected as many of the just as weird seed pod dealies as I could, but know I missed some. They look like 1/4 to 1/2 inch potatoes. I used to think the vine was a perennial, but figured out it reseeds. Now that the grass is gone, I ended up weeding it out of areas beyond where it normally grows.

Today’s trek into the countryside was not the mudfest it was yesterday. But one of our four-wheel drive vehicles (our team travels in two cars), did get stuck trying to cross a small river on our way to the first site visit. We caught the whole thing on video just like a National Geographic documentary. After several attempts by our fearless Haitian drivers, it was decided it’d be best to leave the hopeless SUV behind and just take the pickup truck which zipped across the river, no problem. Once on dry land, Kate and the camera crew gamely climbed into the back of the pickup and we picked our way along the gutted country road going about 15 miles per hour, at most. Occasionally our driver had to get out and place rocks in the deep ruts so the truck would stay level.
I've been looking back on some blog posts from 2011 and I'm amazed at myself. In some areas, I've really come a long way. In other areas, I see that I really didn't move or change at all. I'm kind of blah about that, not sure what I can really say other than I'M HUMAN, so sue me. Ok, no really don't sue me. I'm quite broke. ;)
This week I'd like to introduce you to Sara Mincy. At the time that the book came into conception, I had just fallen in love with Sara and her blog. She immediately struck me as someone I wanted to work with. Sara is a very talented artist, but at the time we started the book, she really wasn't that into sewing. Because the book has projects geared for first-time sewers as well as advanced sewers, Sara's style was a perfect match for the book!
BIG BILDERBERG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU
When triumph appears, I run to the beach, slide on that wetsuit and jump onto my board, letting the glistening sun blind me and the waves guide me. I feel the waves pump through me like the blood through my heart. I put my knee on my board and push down on the nose, duck diving through the crashing waves, feeling it's power wash over me. A Christening of the soul.
#8 - "The Invaders" - One of the greatest actresses of the 20th Century delivers one of the Zone's finest performances in this wonderful game of deception and misdirection. After screening it for a roomful of teens a few years ago I'm happy to say the surprise ending still holds its surprise. Agnes Moorehead delivers a master class in how to sustain attention without a single word of dialogue. And why no dialogue? Not gonna tell ya if ya haven't seen it.
Three types of corporations that can be diminished. The chances for having an IRS audit can be contracted for. They accept contracts for remodeling buildings, roofing and for manufacturing unique home installers. Building contractors must possess special educational qualifications and certificates specified by the northern california labrador and to provide deductible options and prescription drug coverage. Clear Protection also guarantees no rate increases for two years.
You hope for first class, and not second hand.
Also slightly hilarious for me is the complete omission of Sevilla (and I can’t remember if Gary has been or not). I lived with an American last year who was obsessed with this city and would not shut up about it–to the point I got really turned off by the city simply because I was forced to hear so much about it (which I suppose isn’t fair, but oh well). I’ve been to Sevilla a few times and while I liked it, it’s not one of my favorite places in Spain. Good to see Gary and the people who helped him compile the list agree with me!
Book – Yeah, this is a simple one. I love reading them and writing them.
And who knows? Maybe Kevin Costner will shake my hand one day and end up on the winning side of life once again. If the day comes, I hope there are witnesses so I can come back to this post and giggle some more. More than anything, I want my sister by my side so she can share in the moment.
Hello Friends/reades I'm back. Life's been hectic with work. Today my blog's first anniversary and I don't want to miss posting on this special day. I hope I will be regular from now on.
Jack chose not to eat the nuggets; instead, he wolfed down a poppadum (a large chip typically served as an appetizer with mango chutney) and several portions of garlic naan bread. In the past, he's also eaten the curry sauce, but last night preferred to stick with the side dishes.
Tear up the slices of bread and add to a food processor along with 3 tbsp soft butter and a bit of salt and pepper, and pulse until the bread is in uniform crumbs and the butter is well distributed.
I have taken to writing actual lists because I'm afraid the mental lists will be adulterated, what with all the visual distractions and the insidious ravages of aging. And I've been keeping these lists on the Stickies features of my Mactop. The application creates what looks like Post-it Notes, and you can assign different colors and fonts and font sizes to different notes as you organize them by importance. Right now, the sticky note that is front and center is blue, large and filled with big, bold type. These are the things I need to do in the immediate feature, as opposed to the other notes that are just for occasional reference—the cost of the shirts I'll be ordering for the community band, our wi-fi network password, and a recipe for a bleach-cleaning solution for the dog's potty area (it's astro turf and can get pretty rank in the blazing heat, not that we've had blazing heat lately, I say as the bitter wind whips through the chimney and howls like a wolf, and snow is pelting the northeastern part of America during the last week of April. The last week of April!, I repeat because I warned people this would be happening, and I don't think anyone believed me, certainly not the pool people who wanted to open early on account of the "early spring").
Well, I had something in mind to post about tonight. But just as I was about to settle in and type there was a discrete knock at the door. One of the kids had a bad day and decided (since he saw my light on) that he would stop by and vent to the old man for a few minutes.

Attached mittens at the end of each arm ensure that you can move easily from the couch to the garden to the front porch for hot chocolate with the neighbors, without getting cold hands. When you're back inside, just pull the mittens off the hands and tuck into the convenient mitten pocket inside the Eternally Comfy's cuff. So easy!
The Danish resistance was in close communication with the British by various methods, including illegal telegraph machines. The picture below shows a reconstruction of a room with equipment used by a telegraphist.
You can look at a food label to find out how many protein grams are in a serving. But if you’re eating a balanced diet, you don’t need to keep track of it. It’s pretty easy to get enough protein. Here’s an example of how a kid might get about 35 grams of protein in a day:
To haunt us with their truth.
- After being exposed to a small dose of Skiffle in the mid to late 50’s, it has been estimated that from 30,000 to 50,000 British youths immediately created their own groups. Imagine what will happen if the whole world becomes infatuated with it.
But it was the sense of history that amazed me; and Berlin is still a city where the leaves of history lie about in the streets like an untidy autumn. It was inconceivable to me then that one day I'd stand in a reunified city and look back at that first visit as another of those leaves of history, any more than I could really conceive of being over fifty. But I found there the visible and obvious relics of the Third Reich, whose traces had been tidied away in the Wirtschaftswundery Federal Republic which had been Germany for me, up till that week. There were bullet marks still on the buildings - actually, they're still not hard to find, but then the buildings were dirty, and, in the East, often ruinous, as if I'd found myself suddenly in 1946. The Lutheran Cathedral in the city centre was open to visitors but you couldn't go into the main part of the building because it was dangerous. Rubble lay all over the floor, as if in the immediate aftermath of a bombing raid. In the West, of course, the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church tower stood at the top of the Kurfürstendamm, blackened and ruined by the air-raid I was to describe years later in Saving Rafael. But there had been much rebuilding there. Money was poured into West Berlin.
Forgiving does not erase the bitter past. A healed memory is not a deleted memory. Instead, forgiving what we cannot forget creates a new way to remember. We change the memory of our past into a hope for our future. -- Lewis B. Smedes
Over the long weekend in Mali (Easter Monday was a day off for schools and offices here), the country’s process of transition from military to civilian constitutional power was officially launched. President Amadou Toumani Touré appeared on state television on Sunday night, for the first time since before the coup, to announce his resignation. National Assembly speaker Dioncounda Traoré has been meeting with various members of the classe politique in Bamako as well as with the CNRDRE junta, and Mali’s supreme court has convened to pave the way for Traoré’s official designation as the country’s new head of state. This process has been hailed internationally, including by the United Nations, and members of the global media have confidently reported that the coup leaders are stepping down.
As you can see, it wasn’t entirely successful and I have quite a few images which tell me I should probably bring a tripod next time. By this time we’d reached a road which seemed a good place to turn back and walk up the other side of the canal. In changing direction, we went under a bridge which had been decorated with several mosaic panels.
I know that Easter dinner was not the same without the bad manners of our kids at the table... I am hopeful that many Marines showed their bad manners and made you feel at home. I am sure you chewed with your mouth open and even laughed at the fart jokes.... yes these things did happen at our table. We would not want to disappoint!
I am now 50 and feel the same way and I'm sure I will if I reach 80.
I'm willing to guess the word "chain" might not have the best connotations for loyal HowChow readers. It's OK, I usually agree. As a longtime food blogger, I can fully understand the merits of Victoria's duck fat fries compared to the limp, salty things you get at Checkers, or the superiority of a hot-from-the-oven Coalfire pizza to anything advertised as remotely "artisan" from Domino's. But not all chains are bad. Some are even great. Case in point, Rita's Italian Ice.
When I told my teacher about what happened, they tried to get us to “talk it out.” I quit telling anyone because it often just made it worse.
We used to only have companies, or charities and NGOs. Today, we have companies with Corporate Social Responsibility departments, those who commit a percentage of their profits to social causes, and those who run like a business, but their business is social cause.

Meade Design Group has become a tight-knit family over the years, so we have shown that in this year's holiday card. Beneath a family style portrait of the smiling Meade Design Group team, the caption inside reads "This year we wanted to share some memories of our Christmas' past, a glimpse into our Christmas present and to wish you a joyful season yet to come!"; I guess we were feeling nostalgic. The remaining panels are filled with old photos from our childhood holiday memories: opening presents, decorating the tree, sitting on Santa's lap, bundled in winter attire, and all of the merry décor and ensembles that add to the season - all in fanciful, filigree-embellished frames.

She's decided that she is 'shy'. She's always been cautious, and needs a few/several minutes before she warms to a situation or person. I'm happy that she is vocalising her need - I'm shy right now mama. And when she's ready - I'm not shy any more mama! And she leaps in and chats away to child and adult alike.
My initial report on Jamaat ul-Fuqra generated considerable reaction from people all over the country, particularly those who might find themselves within the blast radius — so to speak — of one of the known compounds.
There's so much color and creative energy. While we wandered through the outdoor venue we chatted with people we don't see on a regular basis, talked with vendors and admired their wares, and generally just enjoyed being outside on a beautiful spring day.

While on the surface Jack's life somewhat mimics my beloved Harry Potter, Myklusch quickly differentiates Jack from Harry. While both boys are orphans, are rejected by those around them, have odd 'magical' things that they can't explain happen when they're upset and are then whisked off to a place where people understand them .... Myklusch clearly shows the reader that Jack is 'his own man' complete with his own issues and adventures. What Myklusch and Rowling both have in common is

Nonetheless, the images that go with the messages may not necessarily connect, but they do appeal to the various senses of a tourist. Youthful and vibrant as the images and tags are, the campaign reaches the target tourism market so well, expanding from its regular market of retirees and elderly to the hip and preppy generation. It does invite also the locals to experience the fun in thier own country.
i’m not a risk taker. when i went to this relationship, i said to myself, this is it. no other man will i love, he’s the one forever. i was inspired by my grandmother, we all call her “nanay”. you see, my grandfather or “tatay” is Nanay’s first and last bf and ofcourse, husband. she accepted him as he is– a playboy, a kinda bit immature. when Tatay had a stroke, she took care of him no matter what. she accepted the pain, hardship, struggles and all the things it has. i want something like that. something i can call mine forever.

Over the many months that this blog has been available, one of the most consistently popular posts has been, How to install Midnight Commander under Mac OS X (the easy way, using Rudix). Unfortunately, at the article notes, the developer of Rudix changed his package and while you can still use Rudix to install Midnight Commander on your Mac, it’s not quite as straightforward an installation as it once was.

The other day on Twitter me and a few other bloggers where discussing our most popular blog posts and it seemed that everyone had a range of different things. It really led me to thinking about what exactly makes a post popular? How much is down to content and how much is chance, date and time and where it’s linked to? I found it really interesting to hear what other bloggers most popular posts are their reaction to them and why they think that is. So Vicki at Cosy Books and I have decided to do this post to share with you our blogs most popular posts. We’d also love to know what yours are as well if you’re a blogger so please feel free to do your own post or if you don’t have time leave a comment with what yours are. We’re also planning a discussion post about this topic so all input would be hugely appreciated!

When establishing a logical chain of considerations leading the skilled person from the prior art to the subject-matter of a claim in order to challenge its inventiveness, the most difficult part consists often in finding the incentive of the skilled person to take a particular step. The case-law both in Germany and at the EPO requires such an incentive e.g. for the combination of different pieces of prior art.

When the trail opened up again, my turkey tracks faded out – not sure if it was because they moved off the path, or because the grass growing on it obscured indentations. I continued on, mostly because I love that area and enjoyed being far enough back off the road that I knew I wouldn’t encounter any other people. I thought I might walk all the way down to the river, as I’d never quite gotten there from this direction before. I scared up a couple small groups of white-tailed deer along the way, although they all stared at me for a long time before running away, as though they hadn’t seen people since last fall. I veered off the trail to poke my head into a little wetland area, checking for interesting plants since I had given up on the turkey. As I came back out onto the trail, I heard a rustle behind some bushes that didn’t seem like a deer, and my hopes rose that I might have found a turkey after all. Instead, as I rounded the corner, a round and furry head appeared, tawny yellow and gray and white mixed together, and I found myself face-to-face with a wolf, not 20 yards away. It was as surprised as I was, and bounded back a few paces before stopping to look at me again. I backed up quickly and steadily, keeping my eyes on the bushes that it had come from, and it ran downhill a little farther, also keeping its eyes warily on me, before running across the trail into the brush and towards that little wet area I had come from. A moment later, a second wolf came out of the bush and ran across the road, too. I didn’t see another sign of them, although as I walked back the way I came, I did hear one more quiet commotion in that direction.

The Hutts enjoy the ability to sell to both sides in this disagreement, and are going to be difficult to sway one way or the other. Unless profit can be made over one than the other, the Hutts will sit on their daises and watch the entertainment the Republic and Empire provide them.
Food obsessions, preoccupations with food, and excessive worry & concern about food are now more the ‘norm’ than normal.The biggest issue for me in this carb-cutting frenzy is the impact it has on your mindset. As I descended into the depths of having an eating disorder (anorexia nervosa), I can still remember the transition from feeling totally in control, empowered and invincible about my food intake (or lack of)…to becoming obsessed, overwhelmed and consumed by thoughts and faulty beliefs about food. Almost overnight, it seemed, I went from having total control of my food, to food having total control of me.
Ruhlman's ratio for cookie dough is 1 part sugar : 2 parts fat : 3 parts flour. His book, Ratio, didn't include any recipe or even mention of oatmeal cookies, so I was curious to see what would happen. And surprisingly, if you interpret the ratio loosely and consider the applesauce to be a fat and the whole oats to be a flour instead of an add-in, it nearly holds with this recipe (70 : 140 : 220 or 1 : 2 : 3.14). Pretty cool.
I just wanted to drop in really quickly this monday morning to say a HUGE thank you to everyone who made the launch of the first JSP workshop such a success. We sold 3/4 of the seats in 2 days and sold out completely in a week! My jaw nearly fell on the floor in surprise when I realized the class might actually be full! Thank thank you thank you for not letting me hang out alone in Singapore! :) I'm so excited to be teaching next year and I really hope those of you on the other end of the syllabus will soak in much fruit from the workshop.
My heart is sick of leaping and tripping like an Aintree racer with old knees. These words bounce in my head: wherever I hang my hat. But I have no hat and I have no hatrack and my hair lollops when I cycle through the airport, through the wind. Wherever I hang my head aint my home. I’ve got no more time for head hanging. I’m bored of it. I can’t believe I keep on talking about property.
How can there be any “dignity of the office” of a liar? Whether it is George Bush or Barack Obama, there is no dignity in dishonesty, corruption, greed, narcissism, or even the wars we pursue.
Within days of dropping I-will-not-say-how-many dollars on many yards of gorgeous silk charmeuse, silk chiffon, and a variety of potential applique accent fabrics, I was informed by my instructor that my patron had decided he didn't want to pay for me to compete yet - maybe never. I was crushed, and did a good bit of crying for a few days. Lacking a deadline, and feeling little but sadness and loss when I looked upon my fabrics, research, and sketches, I folded everything up neatly in a box labeled "dream gown," and tucked it away in a far corner of my closet.
Her primary function being, cooking and taking care of her family with three kids. She was always over-powered and over-shadowed by her husband (my dad), and I never realised she was being neglected. She had never complained.
The first best trekking rout here is the Darcha Lamayuru trek. This trek needs 26 days to cover the entire route. You cross Zanaskar, Manali, Darcha, Chumi Napo, Shingo La, Kurgiak, Tetha and many other places as you trek along the trekking track. You need to climb up 6000 meter in the direction of the western end region of the Himalayan range. As you trek along and reach each destination you get to visit the occupants and the see the beautiful natural scenic views from each destination. Your tour starts at Darcha and ends at Lamayuru.

The recent ultra-left socialist organisation Searchlight bussed in London members last month to distribute their Hope Not Hate propoganda 'newspaper' which included a section about various Heanor residents who are active in our community, thus implying that they supported Searchlight's extreme socialist anti-nationalist stance.
My best friend, at the time, had parents who were foster parents to teenage girls. We had a lot of exposure, and decided to pursue foster parenting for younger children. As soon as I turned 21 we got our license. We had many foster kids come and go. Some times we had sad and hard to deal with cases, but we wanted to make a difference for the short time we had these kids.

He relies on his own inspiration of Sakyong Mipong, reformulating this lama's teachings for a wider readership. Sometimes I wanted more depth from his student; although this is a galley proof given for review, it appears to be more or less complete in this version. Lodro Rinzler loads on the references designed to make this up-to-date, but the risk of a shorter shelf life when quoting a particular drink mix or rapper or '80s kid's show does loom. (I think of those earnest recastings of the Good News for Flower Power.) For me, a generation older than Rinzler, I fall into the awkward gap between Chogyam Trungpa's Aquarian Age cohort and Rinzler's--maybe I'm closer to the "hardcore zen" of Brad Warner or as an older brother for Noah Levine's "dharma punx" who grew up after the hippies but before the maturing of a perpetually wired audience. I'm glad to see that Buddhism continues to be rethought and reframed every few years.

So, the liberals want to change free speech? I think they are aware that freedom is dangerous to their agenda. Here is a video via mark Levin:
Wonder what these historians have to come up with about the sky being blue. What meaning does this hold? Is it lunch time for Farmer Jed? Is this the only time of day the Mrs. gets to see her husband, as she delivers lunch, maybe a ham and cheese sandwich (baked beans)? The artist was able to corral the two for a ‘quick pic?’ Why wasn’t the painting set at nighttime? Perhaps hubby needs to be in bed by 5 pm in order to hit the field by 3am?
He then met the American poet Robert Frost, who had come to England to make a fresh start as a poet and under his influence started writing poetry at the end of 1914 believing like Frost that poetry should employ the natural cadences of ordinary speech.

The pub is on a corner and the table was on the pavement alongside the main road. After a half hour of sitting there chatting and watching people walk or drive by we went inside and I did my routine. Again I managed to achieve a first by stripping out of my outer clothes in a pub, admittedly without anyone else around, and getting down to my costume which I'd been wearing underneath.

Things are a bit tricky here, so today I'm skiving my responsibilities and pointing you towards a post that helps you understand why you still need to be able to speak publisher. Read Reasons Not to Self-Publish in 2011-2012: A List by Edan Lepucki (and come back and tell me what you think, if you have the time). I don't agree with all of it, but there are some very important thoughts here. I particularly like that it draws on plenty of other intelligent blog posts to bring together its reasoning.

Carter is for my money, the greatest walking bassist in the history of jazz. Big words, I know - and describing somebody in music as being 'the best' is a risky proposition, since it is ultimately unprovable, and probably undesirable as well - music is after all, not a competitive sport. Maybe it would be more appropriate for me to say that as a walking bassist, nobody satisfies me on so many levels as Carter. Others have had an extraordinarily powerful beat (Ray Brown, Leroy Vinnegar), and some have a relentlessly creative mind when it comes to note-choices for bass lines (Scott LaFaro, Eddie Gomez), but none of combined these two elements in the way that Carter has.

You know I'm a little bit old school in the ways I like to do things. A little bit back to the basics...cloth diapering, breastfeeding, natural birthing, etc. Why? Because they are better. :) Ha. Truly though...I don't think that anyone would argue that point, but for some they just choose to not do it even though they know that it's better. Totally their prerogative. But, all of that to say, when I found the back-to-basics approach of eating, I knew it was for me.
I booked myself into a show on April 14th. It will be the first time I have sun with a band on a stage in gosh, nearly 11 years. Not that I was ever a big deal as a singer but I did it for 15 years and was really really good for a while. I was just crippled with mental illness, non-existent self esteem and I was trying so hard to be what I thought everyone wanted me to be that the act of performance wasn't fun anymore.
Also I brought Poppy in today and spent quite a bit of time grooming her. I gave her hooves a very thorough check then trotted her to find that she wasn't lame anymore. I had fixed up where dirt had managed to start traveling into her hoof when she last got lame by standing on a boxthorn and I used my hoof knife to fix that up. I hope she will stay sound. I'll keep a close eye on her but I hope I found the problem. We had to skip going to Laurens for mounted games this week for obvious reasons but we should be back on track for next Thursday :)

8) I get to write a lot of fight scenes: You can’t write about an assassin character without her getting into some serious trouble and taking on loads of bad guys along the way. Both Gin and Gwen get into lots of battles, which means that I get to write tons of fight scenes. There’s nothing I like better than writing a fight scene and showing how my heroine uses her skills, smarts, and magic to defeat the bad guys.
For instance, in a murder trial, evidence could be that you own a shoe with an imprint similar to the footprint left in blood a murder scene.

The first thing I noticed was Grappa. Grappa is a new addition to the Middelvlei crew and is off the Richter scale in cuteness. Still a puppy and still chewing on things so I had to take a few pictures.
On a whim last week we decided to go out of town for the weekend. We ended up in Hartford Connecticut. We had been there before but we weren’t able to do some of the stuff we wanted to do on previous trips so we decided that this time we would visit the places we wanted to but never could fit in.
This testing was enough to answer the question.... "Does the ammunition actually work as described?" There was another question though, at least in this writers tiny little puzzled mind. Would the frangible bullets destabilize upon striking anything less substantial than a steel target?

At first, the story was a horrible attempt at Mark Twain meets R.L. Stine, with this dorky southern kid running around the woods with no clue that an evil door lay nearby, under which was something that would change the world forever. Problem: I didn't know what lay under the door, and I kept stalling with more and more of the ridiculous (not in a good way) antics of poor Jimmy Fincher.
What did poke out to me, though, was that if a woman decided to do the opposite of me, as in not shave her legs, I guarantee that heads would be turned. So while I didn’t expect anyone to really notice, it was a poke at gender not just because men traditionally do not shave their legs, but for the gross hypocrisy of what would happen if women didn’t do it. Sure, some people might make fun of the guy for shaving his legs, but a woman would be treated as an outcast.

And on Wednesday night I was at a very well-attended launch there for my friend Cath Staincliffe's new novel, The Kindest Thing, published by Constable and Robinson. Held in the events room with its elegant windows overlooking Deansgate and the thirties windows of Kendal's (which always make me expect Superman to come flying in front of them at any moment), it was a lovely evening. The book is a departure for Cath from her detective novels, although it's a crime novel in that it's constructed around a criminal trial, and the very topical case of a woman convicted for helping her husband, who was suffering from motor neuron disease, to die. It's a page-turning read, and yesterday, suffering from a migraine and unable to write yet still able to read, I took the book to bed and gobbled it all up in one day!

What I'm getting at, is that we have a long way to go. We all want to have a sudden resolution with instant canonical solutions. I suspect, from the comments I've seen around the web, that this is so because a lot people, of various ideological perspectives, want to "spike the football". That way of thinking needs to be removed, because the resolution isn't going to come with a bang, but with a long sigh over time, and that for the divine purpose of instilling a good dose of humility where it is apparently in great need. Pride is making too many people impatient, and inflating the egos of many who ought to know better.
But more importantly that the epic baking weekend of calorific joy is the fact that my pal's first published short story is out today on Amazon for your Kindle! I only found out this week so I thought I'd blog about it on release day to let you guys know, in case you fancied a quick read that's something a little different.
Of course, if you have a designated driver or other such chaperone, there's naught keeping you from both save laws against public intoxication.
Now, would I let a 12 year old read my work? Probably not, at least not without their parents reading it first and THEM making that decision together. Who knows. Maybe reading my work will open up the dialog between a parent and their kid about practicing safe and responsible sex. That would be awesome.
week on writing an action scene that would take fifteen seconds to watch on film and (dare I say it?) would probably be more effective in that medium (though obviously the novel trumps film in many other respects), I have to agree. I’ve also seen it argued, at least, that Woolf’s own experimental writing might have been influenced by cinema – montage and the shifting of camera angles and distances.

Watts indicates a balance every journalist is facing between putting enough of themselves into their social media to seem human, while remaining professional. When she says reporters are reporters, part of what she means is that many of the old rules apply to new platforms, such as fact checks and leaving personal opinion out of it – even on staff blogs.
Shoe engineers examine foot imprints of Igor Vovkovinskiy, of Rochester, Minnesota, at Reebok headquarters, in Canton, Massachusetts. Vovkovinskiy, who has a shoe size between 22 and 26, says he’s had 16 surgeries in six years to fix problems created by shoes that didn’t fit. The engineers intend to use the imprints to help create trainers for Vovkovinskiy.Picture: Steven Senne/AP

One of the reasons Saving Leonardo is so demanding for most of us is that it takes the reader through mainly uncharted territory. It causes us to reflect on ideas that we hitherto have not and on a level we are ill prepared to do so. Rather than this being a cause for ignoring this work it should compel us toward it. This information could hardly be more timely.

4. Private companies would not be required to remove identifying information from data they share with the government. Private information could be shared not only with civilian but with military authorities. Given the deference that courts generally show to invocations of national security interests by entities associated with the military, this makes the risks of privacy invasions even more severe. Any information shared under a new legislative framework should go to a civilian rather than a military agency.

But the moment of the night was the promo work done by Fortune, and in particular, AJ Styles. He truly has improved since he was matched up with Flair. You can also see Flair beaming with pride when he is watching him talk, it’s like a father watching his son succeed. I also liked the banter between Flair and Foley. I feel there is some unfinished business between them. But what about the beat down they gave the other 4 men, Jarrett, Hogan, Nash, and Sting? I think it’s way to say this is Fortune’s house and anyone else isn’t afraid in.

The first thing to note about CFS is, it is a label to describe a miscellaneous condition, for which there is no proper diagnosis. Indeed, it is handed out precisely because all the usual tests haven’t shown anything wrong. If something had been revealed – e.g. sleep apnoea, iron deficiency, underactive thyroid or wheat intolerance – then that would be the diagnosed illness.

No, no Santa gifts. Why? When I was 6 or 7, I had a friend, Kim. She informed me there was no Santa. I was devastated. I mean, really, devastated. To learn that there was no Santa Clause! Would that mean I got less gifts? Why did they lie? But, but... So, my parents let me choose. Wrapped "Santa" gifts, or unwrapped ones like the years before when I thought there was a Santa. I chose wrapped (mostly-a few unwrapped). It's just funner that way. (Yeah, I know that isn't a word. It just sounded good.)

No kiddin’. No, not at all. Heavens, man! We had intended for just a few to come when we set up our TV set in the backyard and invited our neighbors over. Since we had a big yard though we had more or less room for everybody. By the way, how is Mrs. Humphreys? All of us, I might say, liked Ike, and over the radio listened to the blues and watched baseball and the Indians play in the World Series on the television, and we saved Indian Head Nickels for luck. O joyous time, it was the New York Giants over the Cleveland Indians (4-0) (and forgit all those ill-wishers and spoiled-sports, Mrs. Humphreys!) The Giants won, and that was that. In the over all scheme of things that year it was huge. With Bob Lemon, Early Winn, and Mike Garcia, how could the Tribe lose? But they did. Also among our basic tenants was the idea that I was the breadwinner and head of the household. What I said (as the breadwinner and the head of the household permit me to tell you if you’re uninformed) was never questioned. Nor did I have to worry about housework. It was a rule. Charlotte took care of it, and it worked as long as Charlotte stayed home and took care of the kids. And this brings me to the point I’m trying to make: those was simpler times. We didn’t lock our doors then and our kids more or less minded us, and if they didn’t…well, we spanked ‘em. And thank God, by and large, niggers stayed in there place, but we still worried ‘bout our children marryin’ one. It had nothin’ to do with prejudice. Now! It was just the way it was.

Last year I had Mr W for Easter. I imagine I posted about it, but can't remember what I'd file it under, so I'm not giving the link. Since we didn't talk about it, neither of us knew that I assumed he didn't want to have an Easter basket, and he assumed that of course I'd make him an Easter basket. Oops. He was truly upset, in the way that a kid who puts up with a lot of untraditional holiday stuff but for cryin' out loud some things are just a GIVEN, could reasonably feel.

“These persistent temptations come from the malice of the devil,” says St. Francis de Sales, “but the trouble and suffering they cause us come from the mercy of God. Thus, despite the will of the tempter, God converts his evil machinations into a distress which we may make meritorious. Therefore I say your temptations are from the devil and hell, but your anxiety and affliction are from God and heaven.” Padre Quadrupani suggests the following strategy: “Despise temptation, then, and open wide your soul to this suffering which God sends in order to purify you here that He may reward you hereafter.”

As the weather cools (yes, it's finally getting below the sweltering temperatures here in Florida) it's the perfect time to head out to the flea markets. How I love to sift through all of the wonderful little trinkets and treasures of times gone by. Some of the odds and ends aren't extremely old, but interesting in that they may remind us of our own past (and sometimes unusual) collections. If these treasures could only speak, we would know the story behind how these bits and pieces of people's lives ended up here on the many shelves and booths of this dusty market.

Indeed, the camera at one point sweeps past the Williamsburg Bridge and the shuttered Domino Sugar Factory; the film doesn't have time to explain the massive New Domino plan to bring some 2200 apartments to an 11-acre site encompassing former Domino property. One selling point for the project, by the way, is the provision of public access to the waterfront.
Many of my farming neighbours have small caravan sites, these often make the difference between keeping ones head above water and sinking. Every Welsh family farm should, within reason, be allowed a small, well-screened caravan site on its land. But a different approach is needed for the vast, often foreign-owned eyesores that stretch for miles along too much of our coastline. To confuse the two, as Rhodri Morgan did, is a deliberate attempt to use the sympathy elicited by the latter to detract from the indefensibility of the former.

A South Indian clerk called Tirumal Appa had become a good friend of Shankar’s. They were of similar age. Tirumal spoke English rather well. He was keen to explore new things. He left home for Africa to explore new lands. That evening Tirumal came to sit next to Shankar. He talked about his family, his younger sister, whom he was really fond of. She was the one he missed most. Now this sister was going to be married off towards the end of September. Do you reckon the engineer sahib will grant some leaves? He asked Shankar.
Barkay’s analysis seems cogent, though it would be good to get some better resolution images to make sure of it. Nothing, however, beats a personal inspection of an artefact, as 2D images can hide critical features (such as the extra letter on the Tel Dan Inscription). The letters בע could also be part of the theophoric element בעל (‘Baal’), perhaps as part of someone’s name. This is less likely, though, given the currently available images. What appears to be a long ‘written’ line along the left broken edge of the seal would seem to match the letter nûn (נ) better than lamed (ל).

I have to be honest I didn't know about the shootings that took place in this book. Which- the more I read this wonderful story- the worse I felt about the fact that I didn't know about them. I was in 8th grade when 9/11 happened, so only in 9th grade when the shootings happened. In Georgia- and the book kind of discusses how it never really made national news- it just wasn't the same. Yes, people die all of the time. But they should also be honored. Everyone is loved by someone.

“Let them be blotted out from the book of the living” (ver. 29). For had they been some time written therein? Brethren, we must not so take it, as that God writeth any one in the book of life, and blotteth him out. If a man said, “What I have written I have written,” concerning the title where it had been written, “King of the Jews:” doth God write any one, and blot him out? He foreknoweth, He hath predestined all before the foundation of the world that are to reign with His Son in life everlasting. These He hath written down, these same the Book of Life doth contain. Lastly, in the Apocalypse, what saith the Spirit of God, when the same Scripture was speaking of the oppressions that should be from Antichrist? “There shall give consent to him all they that have not been written in the book of life.” So then without doubt they will not consent that have been written. How then are these men blotted out from that book wherein they were never written? This hath been said according to their own hope, because they thought of themselves that they were written. What is, “let them be blotted out from the book of life”? Even to themselves let it be evident, that they were not there. By this method of speaking hath been said in another Psalm, “There shall fall from Thy side a thousand, and tens of thousands from on Thy right hand:” that is, many men shall be offended, even out of that number who thought that they would sit with Thee, even out of that number who thought that they would stand at Thy right hand, being severed from the left-hand goats: not that when any one hath there stood, he shall afterwards fall, or when any one with Him hath sat, he shall be cast away; but that many men were to fall into scandal, who already thought themselves to be there, that is, many that thought that they would sit with Thee, many that hoped that they would stand at the right hand, will themselves fall. So then here also they that hoped as though by the merit of their own righteousness themselves to have been written in the book of God, they to whom is said, “Search the Scriptures, wherein ye think yourselves to have life eternal:” when their condemnation shall have been brought even to their own knowledge, shall be effaced from the book of the living, they shall know themselves not to be there. For the verse which followeth, explaineth what hath been said: “And with just men let them not be written.” I have said then “Let them be effaced,” according to their hope: but according to Thy justice I say what?

Final Analysis: The new Wet n Wild Color Icon Eye Shadow Singles in Lagoon and Envy are enough to turn even the most high-end eyeshadow lover into a WnW fan. Seriously, I could not believe I was using a $1.99 eyeshadow when I applied these shades to my eyes. The color, the intensity of the pigmentation, and the smooth application make these pretty darn unbeatable. As for Kitten, I wish that it worked better for me, but I'm just not a fan of texture. If you are sad about the departure of our beloved WnW Ultimate Expressions eyeshadow palettes, I think you will be very happy with the new WnW trios. The shimmers in these trios are at the same level of quality as the U.E. palettes but, in my opinion, the staying power is even better. Also, the brown crease shade in Sweet as Candy is worth the price of the entire trio. It is an incredibly versatile shade that applies like a dream and can be worn in a zillion different ways. I HIGHLY recommend Sweet as Candy if you're a medium-brown eyeshadow lover like myself.

I would argue that the ripples caused by Rosa Parks when she sat on the “wrong” part of the bus in Montgomery, Alabama, on December 1, 1955 ultimately led to the over-throw of aparteid in South Africa in 1994 – almost 40 years later. Certainly, for Ireland, the Civil Rights movement in the US led to The Contraceptive Train in May 1971, when women travelled by train to Belfast to buy contraceptives and smuggle them into the jurisdiction of the Republic of Ireland.

My dad and I just got back from a mammoth walk.
Unfortunately his findings did not please the prejudice of the establishment of the day. Galileo felt that all he had to do was to show everybody that Copernicus was correct and everything would be alright. His second mistake was that he could leave the fairly safe Republic of Venice and return to his native Florence, protected by his incredibly reputation as an inventor and salesman, and now scientist and writer. Sadly this would prove to be fatal.
Long Shirt- Off Shoulder Shirt- Mr. Poet
I just wanted to update you all after my last post! Things are better. I was able to talk about how I was feeling and get it all out and honestly, I think I am for the most part over it. It sucks when the old part of my life comes sneaking in. It’s hard to fight that urge to fall back into that depression, back into the why did this have to happen to me pity party. Hey, the first step to growing is admitting what is wrong right?! One step at a time- that is all I can do!
This article (posted in 2 parts) will explore a triple-murder scene, equivalent to the Griekwastad case and based on information the media has already made public. The emphasis will be mainly on ballistic-related evidence and phenomenon.
It seems to be Catch 22. I am not happy with my husband, but fearful of the damage a divorce could cause my children. Then again, I see the damage that my mother has done to my father, and to me and my brother, and I fear that this could also just get worse for my children over time. Am I naive to think that I can manage and/or lead my husband somehow? The man with whom I truly would like to be companion – whom I have dubbed “amazing” … has been trying to lead his wife who is hateful, verbally abusive, and deprives him sexually. Perhaps he has been more successful in many ways – at least on the surface “converting” her spiritually, but bottom line is that he keeps wanting things to be different, for her to treat him well, give him what he needs and she is not capable of this. Instead, she craves attention of hundreds of facebook “friends” and others in her world – craving popularity. She is not unlike my husband in that way, wanting to be the center of attention. Their primary differences are gender. Amazing is delusional that things can be better for them; and perhaps I am too with my husband. Yet, I still want to be with amazing, and have an amazing, bonding, loving, fulfilling companionship with him and our children. So we are torn between Faith and circumstance. Teachings of the Church would tell us to continue to manage as we have been, to make the most of it, neglect our needs and put others first, right? I do not know. Yet, if those in our lives would be more like Christ and less selfish, things would be better, right? But our spouses are not capable of this and both are often “vulgar and classless.”

I went to the store to buy feminine product and a ga-zillion tins o' cat food. I don't know why I found that to be such a funny scene at the grocery store check-out line....
There’s also the issue of Jesus. I’m not sure, but something tells me Jesus would not be wearing a Slayer shirt, reek of alcohol and tobacco, curse at me if he had late fees, pre-order the latest episode or Halo, or rent Mega-Shark vs. Giant Octopus. I could be wrong. Seeing Jesus in the face of customers who refuse to buy their children candy (‘because that junk food is bad for you’) but then rent or buy them Hot Tub Time Machine because, evidently, their minds don’t matter, is impossible. I’m not opposed to seeing Jesus there or meeting God or creating holy space, but, to be sure, it requires some imagination. I do not know if I have that sort of intestinal fortitude.
Here’s the good news from the race at Talladega, Dodge got it’s first victory in three decades at the monster track. Yep. Over 30 years Dodge ran 0-for-too many. We also have secured another driver for the Chase this year come September. Brad Keselowski notched up his second victory of the season, joining Tony Stewart and Matt Kenseth.
The real temple area – the Sanctuary – was for ritually pure priests and Levites. Nice music, prayer and sweet smelling incense for them only.
We could see the hotel where the wedding would be from the ferry. It was a very fancy hotel with a beautiful view of the city from huge wrap-around windows, with flowers everywhere, paper lanterns hanging from the high ceilings . . . That's a big difference with French weddings, they tend to be in small village halls here. Though I suppose in bigger cities ballrooms in hotels might be common. Restaurants are common here too, for smaller groups. Out where I live, it's usually in the multipurpose room across the square from the town hall. I feel like in the states, the venue is extremely important. Tons of flowers in lush interiors, urban lofts with ice sculptures, lights galore in a marquee in the woods. Here, the food seems to take center stage, in functional rooms with tile floors and nice but not overly ambitious decorations. And really, all of this could be regional. I have been to a wedding at a chateau, which was lovely, but there aren't tons of chateaux in the area, so maybe other more chateau-y regions have nicer reception halls. And I'll bet people who live closer to the beach in France use it for weddings. At least, I hope they do!

Cricket podcast is the action indoor cricket through which they can always remain connected to their favorite game. Fans have started attaching their emotions with the play indoor cricket and results of the indoor cricket nets is completely free to express all that he has not played well. The game of cricket.

I had my knee worked on a couple of days ago so I am gimping around butt I am sure in a couple more days I will be right as rain.
The summer of our wedding drew on toward the September date. We were an untraditional wedding couple in many ways. We were both long gone forth from the homes of our parents, and we'd lived together for several years. Neither of us had living mothers to create the framework (or hysteria) of some weddings. So our wedding, as I have mentioned here, was planned and executed by our own ingenuity and the breathtaking generosity of our families and friends. We were registered nowhere; there was no list of desired small appliances, no selected patterns of silver or china. In any case the only china I wanted was the simple pattern of my childhood - the cheery pink roses of my grandmother's Franciscanware. But my grandmother was gone and I had no connection with my father, and in any case, there were bigger fish to fry. My friend Tracey was making my dress; my aunt would make the lovely wedding cake. Rodney's brother would pay for the beer, and his oldest childhood friend furnish the limo. You know all this; I've told you the tale before. And it was pretty much all I talked about, as brides do, and there on the corner of Charlotte Street and Cathedral Place, I talked about it with all the Booksmith regulars. They listened, told their own wedding stories, wished us well, and bought their books.
Sunshine in Melbourne is worth its weight in gold. I am originally from Perth, where social gatherings are dominated by the outdoors. Melbourne is a different story, owing to the unpredictable weather! So its really lovely to be able to stare out across the river and lounge around on the grass, kick the football and, as we discovered, spray the birthday boy with champagne!

All of them seem to be doing good. They're all very small, and want to explore all of their new home, but they're babies so they also just can't resist falling asleep! They go run all over their cage and then start getting sleepy and doze off and fall on their nose. Then one of the chicks wakes up and starts cheeping and then the other chick gets woken up and then she goes back to sleep (in a better position.) They're SO, SO, SO cute!!!! :D

Mass is the golden key of heaven, God the Father gives it to you, and with it we may have all other blessings if we will. If then we find ourselves poor in virtue the fault must be ours, for God, by this key, opens his treasures to us, and would liberally bestow them upon, did we not hinder him by not disposing ourselves to receive them. If we draw but little advantage from Holy Mass, it is our own fault; if our debts are still great, it is a sign we do not take care to pay them by the means God has so bountifully furnished us with.

But ... there is a price to be paid. To get the artwork scanned you have to ever so, ever so, evvverrrr so carefully pull the artwork off it's backing board. In the 1980's illustrators could buy artboard specifically for this purpose - it was called stripper board and you would pull up the corner and then gently roll the corner away from you using a cardboard tube to wrap the thing around. This is what seems to have happened with Barr's painting, only the board he created the picture on was not being as co-operative as the person tasked to perform this operation might have hoped and it looks like the operative placed with this delicate task might had substituted an object of much smaller radius to anchor the paper on as he rolled it off it's board.

Mr Young is a very good shopping companion. He truly is.

You have also started sleeping in your own room. To be honest, we just started this last Friday so it's only been a few nights, but it still counts. I know, I know. We probably should've moved you to your room earlier, but I wanted you near me (and still do). Let's just say it's probably harder on Mama than it is on you. I may or may not be sleeping in the floor of your room right now ;-). I just find it comforting to have you near me. But I guess moving you to your room is just a part of you growing up. I'm going to be a hot mess when you move away to college. Maybe you should just go to UT and live at home....just kidding! I would never allow that. You're going to be an Aggie!

When we arrived in Cuba, I looked at the landscape. It was beautiful. First, we went to visit their families, they were so friendly. But we could not spend the night with their families, it was forbidden. That surprised me, but unfortunately that was not the only meaningless law in the country. The myth of communism fell when I reached Cuba. In my opinion, if Che Guevara saw Cuba today he would feel disappointed. On the other hand, I must say that people are much happier in Cuba than in Europe. In fact, everything is different.

Margaret Walcott, Ann's cousin, is desperately in love and consumed with fiery jealousy. She is torn between staying loyal to her friends and pursuing the life she dreams of with her betrothed.
Yet on the other hand, your family’s open condemnation of homosexuality and your pestering feelings of guilt are not helping you and I think these could do a lot of harm as you learn about the best way to proceed. Talk to a counselor. I would highly advise speaking with a therapist who is skilled in sexual orientation and sexuality counseling. You are carrying a lot on your shoulders and unreasonably so. You need guidance and community to help you find others going through a similar challenge. You are not alone!
Moab!!! For Easter my family went to Arizona, but because of seminary teaching I couldn't go.. however my new bestie Megs and I planned a trip to Moab... We didn't want to leave anyone out, so we invited the whole ward! I knew that not everyone would come because of family plans... but we ended up with 28 people! It was a total party! We stayed at my parents house and we just played :)

With roughhousing fathers demonstrate to their children appropriate measure of winning and losing. From rough play with dad, children learn to test their limits; they learn to discover their identity.

Today’s Thought:
In 1974, now partnered with Pattie (they would not actually marry until 1979) and no longer using heroin (although starting to drink heavily), Clapton put together a more low-key touring band that included Radle, Miami guitarist George Terry, keyboardist Dick Sims, drummer Jamie Oldaker, and vocalists Yvonne Elliman and Marcy Levy (also known as Marcella Detroit). With this band Clapton recorded 461 Ocean Boulevard (1974), an album with an emphasis on more compact songs and fewer guitar solos; the cover version of “I Shot The Sheriff” was Clapton’s first #1 hit and was important in bringing reggae and the music of Bob Marley to a wider audience. The 1975 album There’s One in Every Crowd continued this trend. The album’s original title, The World’s Greatest Guitar Player (There’s One In Every Crowd), was changed before pressing, as it was felt its ironic intention would be misunderstood. The band toured the world and subsequently released the 1975 live LP, E.C. Was Here.[36] Clapton continued to release albums and toured regularly. Highlights of the period include No Reason to Cry (a collaboration with Bob Dylan and The Band); Slowhand, which featured “Wonderful Tonight” (another song inspired by Boyd);[37] and a second J.J. Cale cover, “Cocaine“. In 1976 he performed, alongside a string of notable guests, to pay tribute to the farewell performance of The Band, filmed in a Martin Scorsese documentary called the Last Waltz.

Blackberries (Rubus species) on Hawaii are non-native alien pests, and in several places they are considered highly invasive and need to be controlled. We came across some enormous, ripe berries in Poli Poli Springs on Maui. They tasted great, but the blackberry canes were very large, and very spiny. On Kauai, people were hiking at Kokee State Park and covered in scratches from the blackberry canes. Hikers are encouraged to report the blackberry infestations to the park employees for removal and control. Blackberries are spread by birds and by underground growth of the roots. While they make a great trailside edible, they do not belong in Hawaii and we can see how they could easily take over whole areas. Blackberries like to grow in disturbed areas like trails and open fields.

I am trying to decide if, when and how I should reach out to this couple. I don't want to overstep my bounds as I have never met them. Hell, I don't even know their names. Do I give them a list of resources; online forums, grief support groups, my phone number? Do I send them a card via the sitter?
However, I have never made anything like these. Not only that, I have never eaten one either. They always look incredibly fiddly to make and I have immense admiration for anyone who does make them. They’re on my bucket list for a day when I’m feeling brave and frivolous.

I’m glad this episode picks up almost immediately where the first one left off. That lends itself to compelling storytelling in my opinion. I hope the trend continues throughout the run of the show, but I’ll have to wait and see since I’m only two episodes in. Oddly enough, there is no actually game footage in this episode which both surprised me and impressed me. I think it would be pretty easy for the writers to make sure that a portion of a football game was present in every episode and I’m glad they didn’t do that. Of course, I expect there will be plenty of football to be seen, but I’m pleased with the tone the writers have set so far.

Lunch was a blur of mystery meat and milk. She didn’t taste a morsel. All she could think about was Brad finally knowing how she felt. She had watched a movie on television about a woman who was in love with a man, only he didn’t know it. This woman had sent him a letter anonymously, but the man knew it was from her. He rushed to her and professed his deep and eternal love and they lived happily ever after.

The main bulk of the film focuses on Mr. Brooks’ battle of wits with Mr. Smith (Dane Cook), who caught him in a photograph the night of his last kill. Mr. Smith does not go to the police and instead wants Mr. Brooks to teach him how to kill someone. Demi Moore’s subplot also takes up a lot of the runtime, and along with all the other subplots, the film becomes a virtual meltdown of action-packed insanity. The film works because of its fast pace, as it keeps the thrills and suspense building right until the very end.

Glasman here misses the point almost entirely, which is surprising given his previous analyses of England’s plight. The members of the EDL are almost certainly interested in a ‘better life’, but this is another overly simplistic oversight of what their key concerns are: the erosion and official abandonment of English Christianity and its laws, customs, architecture, culture, literature and distinct identity. And the danger of its being supplanted by the state religion of multiculturalism.

I suggested to take a ladder and try to get Arthur down. Which he did, cursing under his breath. when he had to go into the garden shed and take it out. It's amazing what Italians have a treasury of bad words ! And on top of it, it rather sounds nice not so ugly as when you are swearing in another language. Apparently dispite all efforts we were quiet noisy and suddenly some windows had opened and heads looked out. The scenery must have been worthwhile to look at.

We argued. We talked it out. Things surfaced that neither one of us had been aware of before. There were tears, apologies, promises to work and do better in the future. The evening ended with us curled up on the couch together, me dozing off with my head in his lap. There were no lingering bad feelings or resentment…simply a deeper understanding of one another, and a renewed sense of why relationships take work sometimes…and why that work is so incredibly worth it in the end.

Not exactly myths in the strict sense, but one of my earliest memories is being read a collection of fairy tales I still have. There was a time - I must have been five or six - when my dad read Rapunzel to me every single night! I always preferred the scarier stories, the thrill of following a character’s journey through the most unimaginably terrible situations, from being trapped in a tower by a wicked witch, to being set the overwhelmingly impossible task of spinning wool into gold, to the horror of realising the gingerbread house in the deep, dark woods is anything but a safe haven.
My friend and I thought it would be a great idea to spend the night at the casino…we rented a hotel room with a shuttle service and had every intention of getting completely obliterated for the night.
Now, I didn't say anything, but I was thinking ^%$#, !@#$;^%$. It's 2 in the morning. Instead of giving me a ticket for driving like a tourist, they get out of the car and strole into the hotel. Not a good sign... at least they aren't after me. But knowing they were there for someone IN the hotel had me a bit worried.
“Yes, I do, but it‘s fun!” I say smiling. I’ve heard all this before. In fact, I hear it every time I go anywhere with my brood.

The sort of vibe that, for instance, might lead you to wonder when you compared the list of nominees with the list of this man's clients, whether there was some kind of a stitch up going on? By my reckoning there's about a 50 per cent correlation between those two lists (though interestingly it's the newcomers and the best live act nominees - the two sections with the least opportunity for middle-man input - that most noticeably buck the trend).
Everybody has an opinion. Once your book is out there you will receive negative reviews. I’ve heard stories that just make my mouth hang open where authors will actually track down their poor reviewers via the web and hassle them to take down the review. People…that is not professional. It isn’t even honest. Receiving negative feedback is part of the risk in publishing. If you don’t like it, don’t publish. Plus, as you’ll see here, those negative reviews are important to me if I want to read your book. “Haters gonna hate,” and if a book is good I expect it to have some haters. Backwards thinking? Maybe. But if you have twenty good reviews and two bad ones, your book is more legit than one with ten five-starred reviews.
Carbon Material: Breakthrough In Energy Storage – “Engineers and scientists at The University of Texas at Austin have achieved a breakthrough in the use of a one-atom thick structure called “graphene” as a new carbon-based material for storing electrical charge in ultracapacitor devices, perhaps paving the way for the massive installation of renewable energies such as wind and solar power.”

Evidence of this hegemony and part of the reason this hegemony has been so complete and powerful is that White Westerners have had an near monopoly when it comes to holding positions of power, authority and influence in Christianity. For centuries the most prominent and influential theologians, leaders, speakers and Christian communities have been White Westerners, most of them male.

How much do items cost in the store? The items in my store cost from one cent to twenty cents. You'll have to just guess for your first store set-up but then after you see what the hot items are you can price based on what the hottest items. If you want a general idea- pencils are two cents, plastic rings are five cents, cheapy party favor glasses are twelve cents, glitter pens are eighteen cents in my store.
I used to use knitting as a way to deal with stress and other negative feelings. When I'd start feeling keyed-up, I'd sit down with my yarn and knit until I exhausted those feelings of rage and revenge. Nobody was maimed, and I got a pretty article of clothing out of the deal. Win-win, right? I guess it was at the time. I've spent the last eight years executing stitch after stitch as I mulled over conflicts in my life; hours of methodically working through my stress and anxieties, and I now have a closet full of accessories to show for my labors.

All candidates should be vetted and should understand that “We the People” are the actual ones they answer to. Lets not give our freedom up to those with a polished speech that holds no substance. So whether you are bored by the debates and all the political talk, remember that this all comes down to us doing our job!! I’ve been told more than once that work would not always be fun and would be boring at times, but that is what is required in order to live freely. So, for those of us who took the holidays off and are resistant to jumping back into the fray…saddle up and lets get busy!

I was standing at the top of a mountain. I was alone at first, and then suddenly Jill was there. She looked just the way I remember her. She was wearing jeans and a tee shirt, with her hair pulled back into a pony tail. She smiled at me, and she had this warm glow about her, and she told me how happy she was to see me.
We were suffering withdrawal from lack of news. Monday we didn't try to venture out until late in the day and all the newspapers were sold out. Tuesday Mr. B went out early and bought three newspapers! News at last. Reading that 80% of homes in Eastern Connecticut were without power made me realize how lucky we had been. Many traffic lights were out on one side of town and it was chaos.
Incidentally, --- the swastika was a sacred symbol in Shamanism, Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Mithraism religions 100’s of years before the German Nazi Party adopted it. The symbol was introduced to Southeast Asia by Hindu kings and remains an integral part of Balinese Hinduism to this day. It is a common sight in Indonesia, and still is an important symbol in Mongolian culture. Source

By the end of his life, Bonhoeffer had very few friends, family, or colleagues who did not think he was taking his discipleship too far. Most of them had found subtle ways to compromise and survive. He refused to do so—and paid the ultimate price.

He stopped, my legs lying over his knees and he was rubbing my calf with a finger. It was a strangely intimate gesture. My stomach was all fluttery and my heart was pounding. I was beginning to rethink what I had told Heather. If Dane asked me out, would I have the courage to tell him no? To tell him to figure out what he wanted? I really didn’t know anymore.
The charm of knowledge would be slight, if there were not so much embarrassment to overcome on the route to knowledge.

I was talking to a fellow Charmed fan friend of mine who also watches TVD, and he and I agreed that Esther shouldn’t be able to use her powers in Rebekah’s body because there’s nothing natural about Rebekah. She’s essentially cutting herself off from nature by locking herself in her body. I’m hoping it’s body who’s put that ring of salt around the house. For what reason? I don’t know, but I don’t think Esther should be able to channel her power through Rebekah’s body. Thoughts?

Taking Chances is a sweet tender romance that makes you feel good. Things are not always as they appear. Abie is quick to assume things and it was refreshing to watch how things came about. I found the dynamics between Tyler and Abie. The flow of the story was flawless and I liked how Tyler and Abie grew as individuals and as a couple. Tyler had skeletons in his closet and Abie has her own issues to work on. I did feel that Abie needed to open up a little more about her childhood with Tyler. I would like to see a story about Josh and I would like to see what happens to Ted. Then we could also catch up with Tyler and Abie! Just an idea Ms. Manderino. If you have not read this story you are missing out. I will be reading this one again and would recommend it. No swearing, but does have some kissing!

Important to note about the American plan for global domination through massive warfare is that it is not really a secret, and as (curiously) revealed on the tenth anniversary of the 11 September attacks upon the United States when the US National Security Archive released a memo written by former US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld in September 2001 wherein he warned “If the war does not significantly change the world’s political map, the US will not achieve its aim.”

About the time we came home from our first trip, I began to think about a pediatrician for our boys. Eli and Julie are very healthy and normally, only see a doctor once, maybe twice a year. We live in a small town and don't have a lot of choices when it comes to doctors. I knew our boys (especially Joseph) were going to need someone experienced. I prayed. I asked God to please show me who to take these precious gifts to for medical care. During our homestudy classes I met a wonderful couple who had brought their son home from Haiti. Mom had met him while doing medical missions work and had sent me a friend request on facebook. Sondra is a NICU nurse and I just felt like God was leading me to ask her for a recommendation, so I messaged her and she made one.
You are smart. You are kind. You are important. You are intelligent. You are whoever you want to be. Don’t believe that old adage, “sticks and stones may break your bones but words will never hurt you.” Words, images or portrayals, can and do hurt. The secret is not giving those things power over you. Recently some of my people were up in arms over Mary J. Blige in a Burger King commercial singing her heart out about a chicken wrap. The problem wasn’t the wrap but rather the word chicken. Back in the day blacks were caricatured and stereotyped in regard to fried chicken and watermelon. Therefore some of us dare not eat chicken or watermelon publicly.

Just seconds earlier I had been blogging my little fingers away at a speed that would give Mavis Beacon a run for her money, but one distracting glimpse from Mila with her fashionably casual bedroom attire and delicious looking latte and my entire motivation was shot. God she's hot. Eff you Mila, it's not July anymore, you're old news. (Just kidding Mila you're never old news. I like your hair, so shiny...do you ever come to Billings? I love you...what?)

I was struck by this afresh as I read in 1 Samuel 10, where Saul was to be publicly anointed as Israel's first king. Saul had previously met with Samuel and knew that he was to be God's chosen man for this task. Yet, when it came time for the public anointing, verse 21 said he was not to be found. When they couldn't find him, they asked God where His man was at. God said, "He has hidden himself among the baggage."

Y'all are gonna think I'm crazy, but Laney and I are actually going BACK to Ohio on Thursday with my mom, only this time we're going to Cincinnati to visit Walk and Em!!! We're driving, not flying (thank goodness). Oh! the plane ride! OH THE PLANE RIDE!!!!!! AHHH!!!! So our flight there kept getting delayed and we flew out of Montgomery around 8:30pm, then we were delayed in ATL and didn't leave there until midnight!! Do you think Laney just laid her sweet little head on my shoulder and fell asleep, like a little lamb??? OR do you think she SCREAMED THE WHOLE FLIGHT FROM ATL TO COLUMBUS!?!? That little lamb did no sleeping of any sort! She was a crazy baby, which was to be expected, we had kept her out WAY past her bedtime and she was just too tired to do anything but be sad. I can't blame her, I felt about the same as she did at that point. The return flight was MUCH better, having lots of snacks helped (thanks, Claire), so did the videos I uploaded to my iphone. I think next time we fly, I'll make sure and pick a flight that leaves WAY earlier in the day--noted.

He discovered beers and beer styles that few people had heard of, and his well-written books on beer are all seen as the authoritative guides on the topic. His books - starting out with the "World Guide to Beer" as early as 1977 - provided the ultimate inspiration for the craft beer movement.
Xander wasn't with me. We hadn't taken him out much at that point, and we definitely weren't taking him to church. Old people wheezing and sneezing into their gooey handkerchiefs. Toddlers touching every surface in the chapel with their grubby little hands. I exaggerate, but my wife's sister's two kids were perfectly healthy for 18 months, the age when Mormon babies are allowed in the nursery at church while their parents go to Sunday School. Within hours both kids ended up in the hospital with RSV. True story.

Okay, time to get back into blogging. So Fall has yet to really hit us in the Bay Area. We're still wearing shorts and t-shirts during the days, and summer berries are still making a weekly appearance at our farmer's markets.

Most of the food blogs I follow are in the full swing of Fall baking, and even though it's still summer here I can't resist making all these lovely treats.

It was difficult, but Casey found peace with her attackers and the horrible experience she went through. She learned to accept the fact that she can’t change any of it, and found a way to go on with her life. She realized that the gang rape had been a terrible thing, but she didn’t define her. Casey was thankful that they didn’t physically beat her or make her perform any seriously, perverted acts. She realized that what she had been through was terrible, but it could have been a thousand times worse. Although she was able to forgive and forget, Casey went years without looking for an intimate relationship with anyone because of her past. When Casey was in her thirties and went home for a visit, she rediscovered Pascal, who was still hopelessly in love with her. This is when Casey’s life began. Although no one ever knew about her horrors that night, Pascal knew, in his heart, that it wasn’t a good experience for Casey.

He is IN LOVE with his hands. While he found them and put them in his mouth at about 2.5 weeks, he's become OBSESSED. He has learned to clasp them and so he either has them clasped or in his mouth. It's impossible to see him otherwise. Which means he is drooling even more. He gets puddles on himself or you--or your sleeve. If you hold him, he'll try to grasp your sleeve and put it in his mouth. I hear they drool more when they're teething and I can't imagine that. I'm surprised he's not perma dehydrated! He can almost fit his entire fist in there, and constantly tries. If he keeps it up it will be quit the talent to impress others at Scout Camp!

(By the way, in the dub, the three in that first picture aren’t dubbed over; their voices are simply left as is, which is fine since it helps with the fact that everyone spoke Japanese in the original, so they shouldn’t've been incomprehensible to Roger… nor should their writing system be. This seems to be why the men speak weirdly – it seems to be meant to imply that even though they are speaking the same language, they aren’t.)
Until the realignment is complete, then, we are likely to see even more destructive xenomania than before. This, in turn, will produce even sharper indignation from the electorate.

But still we are likely to suffer before the definitive backlash comes.

I have been asked many times whether or not I listen to music while writing or reading. I honestly don’t know how anybody could read for long periods of time while listening to music, as it’s far too distracting, but when it comes to writing, it’s a different story. Perhaps it’s because I am so concentrated on writing, that my mind blocks out the lyrics while I try to express myself, often with my feet tapping (or sometimes dancing while sitting – a talent indeed), but it is rare I find myself writing in silence.

One violent incident that I will suggest was engineered 'higher up' was an attack made some while later, in September 1997, on my wife and me. This was on an occasion when we were walking from our car to a party meeting in Stratford, East London. Our security was slack this time - something for which I hold myself entirely to blame. A left-wing mob of some thirty or forty people were in the vicinity, having know about the meeting and arrived with the intention of disrupting it. We walked right into them. Not being satisfied with venting their hatred and fury on me, they hurled my wife to the ground, whereupon several of them kicked her about the head and body as I stood over her, desperately but mostly unsuccessfully trying to protect her from their blows. We were fortunate that the incident took place in a busy public place on a Saturday afternoon. Seeing onlookers gather, and fearing that they might later be identified by witnesses, the mobsters withdrew after having inflicted a few superficial injuries on me about the face and head. The head wounds that my wife suffered still troubled her some months afterwards. In our experience we were lucky compared with some of our colleagues, but my memory of the despicable assault by these animals on my wife remains with me. Were I ever to confront any of them agains, I could not ensure to act with 'moderation' or 'restraint'. Yet of course the media continue to persist in their subtle linkage between the BNP and violence without giving the slightest hint of these conditions under which we have had to operate. No mention of the kicking my wife received was ever made in the mainstream press - an omission which we can be quite sure would never have occurred had the BNP members been the guilty ones and their opponents the victims.

After all! Why should anyone care what you think? It’s not like you have any reason to care what they think. Why can’t they ignore you just like you like to ignore them? The answer is because your situations are different. Some people have to care what other people think. For some people, what other people think actually affects their ability to live their life in peace. To give one example, a cisgendered straight person really doesn’t need to worry about what LGBT people think of them, but if you think that LGBT people don’t have actual high-stakes reasons to care what cis straight people think of them, I don’t know what universe you are living in but I want to go to there.

Reach out to help others when you are sure you have helped yourself. Don’t blame yourself. Be honest with yourself and know that these things take time. Be clear when thinking about what you want for yourself but don’t decide too quickly. Meditate everyday and practice gratitude, this life is beautiful. You will get through this believe me, I believe in you.
I wish I was a get-it-all-cleaned-up-before-I-go-to-bed girl. I always want to be. Truth is, when the fun evening is over, I want to get to bed with my Pup and snuggle in the big huge bed.
Pour is just what I like; inky black and there's not even color around the edges. It's solid black with a thin head that doesn't last long. Inviting roasty smell. The roast carries on into the flavor, but it doesn't over power the smooth chocolate. The chocolate notes here are not as bitter as other porters. More of a milk chocolate. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. Hops and toasted bread come out more as it warms. Long finish that's dry with just a hint of bitterness.
Scudetta--StellaBaby's boyfriend, who loves to knit, hates crocheting, but as a straight dude, is terrified that Hoodie will "out" him to his coworkers at the fire department. Scudetta keeps his sock knitting hidden in his NY Yankees sports bag, sneaking a stitch or two alone in the locker room.

In ILLEGAL, Lindy is being groomed by her cousin to become his drugs courier. She is terrified of ending up in prison like her two brothers. But there is no-one in her family to turn to. She teams up with a boy from school, Karl, who is mute after a trauma two years earlier. Although Lindy mocks Karl at first for not speaking, she actually prefers his silent world. Karl helps Lindy to find a way to report Colin to the police without revealing themselves.

That brings to my mind a question – So why did God reveal Himself to Jacob if he was such a schemer and liar – Because above all else, Jacob sought the Lord. He is an example of someone who had an open heart and was willing to change and God encountered him in spite of how bad he looked to others. Remember that He exerted all physical energy he could to hang on to God when wrestling. It was only when God touched his hip that Jacob released his grip on God. You will realize God’s presence only when you seek it more than pleasure, food, financial security, sensual things or any other thing in life. We can encounter God when we give up everything to experience Him. Many of you unfortunately will not have a God encounter like I am talking about because you are not willing to give up things. You might not want to give up that sin that so easily besets you because you like the power it gives you so you just tell people you cannot change. You might want to have money more than an encounter with God so you seek money hard and just give God your left over time. You might want entertainment more than God so you continually skip godly activities so that you can be entertained. Let me ask you – could it be said of you – above all else, you seek the Lord?

One English word for food which ironically, I had never really heard until I came to the Philippines, is viand. Apparently this is a poetic word, meaning simply, “item of food.” But it is used in Philippine English for “something to go with your rice” (Tagalog ulam). You see, over here, rice is the basis for the meal, and everything else is a side dish. In fact, a birthday party serving “only” fried chicken and spaghetti will be considered a snack unless there is also rice. Only rice makes it truly a “meal.”
Another week, another Stitch Fix post! I know, I know. I thought I'd make this one a little more fun (or at least less redundant) by doing it in a vlog! I don't do many vlogs... not sure why. But I think it's because I get severely embarrassed before I even hit "record"... seriously. And I say "um" a lot and have weird mannerisms and of course talk like the world is ending in 30 seconds and I have a whole chapter to recite. Whatever. Here I am in all my weird speech glory!

So what the hell is Lelouch thinking when he did that? I of course know what the writer is thinking when they wrote that- to spice up the melodrama to portray how sad Lelouch is so sad and so resolute because he makes someone he loves totally forget about him and he sacrifices all that because he is oh so going in the wrong path. However, the stupidity of his action that may cause a lot more inconvenience for himself pretty much jeopardies what the writer is setting up for.

All that said, my closet has been getting a bit unruly lately – I don’t know what’s gotten into it – and I need more space. I thought about asking hubby (very nicely, of course) to move his things to the garage, but that wouldn’t be right…would it? Anyway, desperate times call for desperate measures, so I decided to swap my beloved wood hangers in the coat closet for slim, huggable-type ones* (pictured above) to see if the change made any difference.

But I have learnt that maybe we shouldn’t be so self-concious about trying things like this. I was worried about looking uncoordinated and silly, but I learnt that a lot of the other women there are worried about looking silly too. And a lot of the other women there DO look silly. So I guess what I’m saying is, even if you think you look silly doing something, give it a try. Because after you have tried it once, there is always going to be someone who is newer than you, and looks more silly than you do. And someone with a bum bigger than yours.

Charlie – a big big star at the time – appeared in BBC TV’s The Charlie Drake Show every week. It was live and he was known for his physical comedy. On this one particular night, as part of a slapstick story called Bingo Madness, he was pulled through an upright bookcase and thrown out of a window on the studio set. There was then a very long pause when nothing happened and then the credits rolled. The next morning’s papers reported that Charlie had been knocked out by going through the bookcase and was unconscious when thrown out of the window.

Following are excerpts from a sermon by leading Sunni cleric Sheikh Yousef Al-Qaradhawi, who heads the International Union for Muslim Scholars (IUMS). The sermon aired on Qatar TV on October 30, 2009.
True-May sought only to preserve an illusion of homogeneous whiteness in a tiny, fictional corner of a once white land, for this he was suspended, pilloried in the press, and swiftly forced out of the profession in which he had spent his working life. No doubt he will be ostracised by his one time colleagues and peers, none of them wishing to have their own reputations sullied by association or, indeed, their abject submission to the cult questioned by their masters.
I write this to confess all that I have done ignorantly or intentionally in the past. I regret my action today for all I thought was for my good and the good of my family. Not until this piece, no one knew the relationship that bonded me and Charlyboy. I have worked for him from behind the scene for over 25 years now, but no one knew, not even my family, not to talk of his staff or his family members. I know that after this confession, I may run far away from anywhere close to the Areafada, but I have to say this just to clear my conscience. I believe, I was an agent of Charlyboy’s Illuminati philosophy. I was the go-between him and his team from the US and the United Kingdom to South Africa and Ghana. But today, I’m tired. I have decided to back-out because even with all the money that I have made through Charlyboy, I have not been able to control my life. Like many other people, I have lived my life for Charlyboy. Life is not just about money alone, but peace of mind. Let me face it today, and let all the money go the way they came. I’m not scared. I can’t be slave to money.

According to LiveMint, MMV decided to stop funding the project after it reviewed preliminary data and other portfolio priorities. According to results that were presented at a conference in 2006, MMV found that results of Ranbaxy’s trials were not very satisfactory compared to other drug candidates available in the agency’s many collaborative projects. By this time, Ranbaxy had spent about $16 million. Despite losing MMV’s support, it planned to continue the development of the drug.

Dirty Filthy Love, thankfully, keeps it real. It represents. Mark's fears, compulsions and tics aren't cute and filmi - they're awkward, painful and, often, baffling. When Mark hits bottom, it's not rock star glamorous, it's ugly and uncomfortable to watch. Tragically, Mark is fully aware that he is suffering from some deep problem, but he has a terrible time pinpointing what, exactly, is wrong - a characteristic of OCD. In the sea of anxiety that Mark navigates every day, everything seems threatening. And Mark's "cure" isn't a miracle drug or a cuckoo's nest (sorry, Jack) or love (sorry, Jack) - it's not even a cure at all, but more of a management technique. Shout out for cognitive behavioral therapy!

Last year we made hedgerow spindles and spun wool fibre we’d collected from sheep fences which was dyed using local plants. It was fun too and showed you don’t have to have money to make fibre.

Bermuda is a tiny little chihuahua (maybe mixed with rat terrier) who is three years old. She's a little shy, probably because she's so small, she's pretty defenseless! Bermuda charmed me right away when I first met her. She cowered away when I tried to pet her, but then she stood up on her hind legs and wrapped her "arms" around her foster dad's leg... exactly like a toddler who doesn't want her mommy or daddy to leave! The foster dad laughed, kissed Bermuda on the head, and said that she always does that when she thinks he's leaving!

As the drawing came together little by little, I was very happy with the scene unfolding before my eyes and hands. The somewhat sad, innocent eyes staring out from under the raccoon’s characteristic little bandit mask can make your heart melt and cause you to forget that he may someday grow up to be a nuisance. Additionally, I started to feel as though I could imagine how soft and fluffy his baby fur would be if I could reach into the picture and stroke my hand down his head or under his chin. Finally, I was very happy with the bark texture of the tree trunks framing the raccoon’s face on each side.

The hero is Dr. Richard Walker (Harrison Ford). He and his wife, Sondra (Betty Buckley), fly into Paris early in the morning, tired, disoriented and cradling each other. Walker is supposed to go to a luncheon later, but he’d rather not attend; in defiance, he teases his wife, crumples up his speech notes and stuffs them in his mouth. He’s not really here to be a spokesman at a boring medical seminar—he just wants to spend the day with his wife. As Polanski illustrates for us, they’re very much in love. But that love is put to the test when Walker wakes up, looks around, and is dumbfounded when his wife is not there. Nor is she anywhere else in the vicinity of their hotel. She has disappeared.

According to the USDA Bulletin #8, “Composition of Foods” (Haytowitz and Matthews 1984), dandelions rank in the top 4 green vegetables in overall nutritional value. According to data, dandelions are nature’s richest green vegetable source of beta-carotene, from which Vitamin A is created, and the third richest source of Vitamin A of all foods, after cod-liver oil and beef liver! They also are particularly rich in fiber, potassium, iron, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus and the B vitamins, thiamine and riboflavin, and are a good source of protein.

The Smart Cover attaches to the side of your brand new iPad 2 and protects the front glass while not in use. Similar to the original iPad’s iPad Case, the Smart Cover also acts as a stand for the iPad, and can prop it up in two different positions. But unlike the iPad Case, this go around Apple has opted for weight and thickness reducing protection, by only covering the front glass of the device. Apple says that the strong aluminum back of the iPad can handle being exposed to whatever it may face, but I disagree, and I almost wished they had made a case that covered the back. Almost. Once I actually went out and purchased my Smart Cover, I almost completely changed my mind.

This has to be my most belated review to date, it was way, way back in November when I first began reading When God Was a Rabbit and a lot has changed since then. As I mentioned in my last post, since November I have moved towns, got a new home and a new job. When God Was a Rabbit has been a strange book to read through these changes. Having just moved away from the town where I grew up and left my parent’s house, the home I’ve lived in since I was just five years old, it has been odd to read a story which poignantly pays tribute to those strange bonds that tie a family together.

People’s sense of civilization is definitely tested because of the brutal act that happened at the playground, with the parents linking it to what’s happening with children in Africa, and their individual takes on that is quite eye-opening. It also sheds light on how people can change as a result of marriage or having children and I think it would be interesting for viewers to identify with the characters and the many parallels they may have with each individual, because any adult in their 30′s or 40′s must have gone through at least one aspect of each of these character’s lives. It’s definitely a wonderful character study and it’s not just a one-timer, because you can always watch it again and find something about each character that you may have not caught a glimpse of before, and that’s what makes a truly great film.
The trouble is, deciding on the warmest year is not a trivial task. It is all very well to ask how the average temperature on the Earth is varying – but how do you find out the average temperature of such a huge body, with such varied weather at any one time? It isn’t actually possible to calculate a meaningful average for the whole world. Apart from anything else, there isn’t a good enough spread of weather stations evenly across the Earth’s surface to achieve this.
In the latest incident some 2000 non-white youths comprising men and women but primarily men, assembled on South Street in Philadelphia and preceded to attack passer-by’s at random, it is notable here however that in the main the objects of the mobs rage were whites, one victim recounts an attack. “At 11:30 p.m. March 20, he and his girlfriend were eating with a married couple at Bliss restaurant on South Broad Street, whose front windows open onto the street.
I figured the best course of action was to meet them halfway, adopt a neutral stance, and let them speak first. See, I told you I’ve been working on it. What happened shook me. They were nice. They were more than nice; they were apologetic. They gave me the history of their son’s behavior and how his comeuppance was long overdue. That it was delivered by a tiny little thing made it all the more poetic. While we laughed and made small talk, I couldn’t stop thinking that our laughter and easy conversation was an endorsement of violent behavior. I mentioned this, and it kind of killed the mood. They awkwardly disengaged themselves, and my wife and I were left with how to redefine and appropriately teach what justice was. Like that would be easy.
Clash (Bay Rong) is most entertaining when allowing Veronica Ngo's Phoenix to be a fiercely scowling hard-edged high kick girl. It's refreshing to witness a strong female presence, exerting her dominance over ex-con male counterparts, threateningly commanding them both with words and fists. She's apt to smack them around as evidenced when Ox gets beaten into begging for mercy after suggesting a new codename for Phoenix, Horny. I love one moment in an early fight scene where the action pauses and a random thug shatters a bottle over Phoenix's head to which she no sells completely, not feigning even the slightest reaction or flinch. This type of imperviousness is often relegated to male action stars so it's great to see the female lead given such a moment. Ngo sells herself well as a believable action star and impressively holds her own in comparison to co-star Johnny Nguyen, who brings a hefty martial arts rep to the table from The Rebel and stuntwork on various big budget Hollywood productions.

Mackenzie (7) is in her fourth year of dance and she has added jazz this year. It's a bit more to keep up with but she's enjoying going at a faster pace. She too is in piano and she can't go through her piano books fast enough. She too had her first recital and played "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" (and sang!). She also played soccer (probably the first and last time only) and did swim team, where she earned Most Improved in her age group! She also has a new set of teeth and is riding a bike without training wheels! And yes, she is in brownies as well. Mackenzie's favorite activity is still reading. She has gotten into Harry Potter this year and has already read the first two novels! Mackenie loves to do things on her own and is very independent. She also likes to tell jokes and kid-around with people. She's fun-loving and loves to learn.

At the very least, I need to learn more so that I can form an educated opinion.

However, its rich, nuanced Tonkotsu broth lured me in, and after Designer Cyclist and hubby headed home, I snuck back to end the show with just one more bite (and sip), hard won through sheer force of willpower (my jeans were seriously in danger of splitting at that point). It was well worth it, and a nice belly-warming finish to an amazing experience.

While I can paint, after a fashion, I was told many years ago, by my Warden (They called the Headmaster a Warden) at the detention centre in Scotland where I was consigned on the Perthshire Archipelago, that there was no money in art. He was wrong about that. Damien Hirst has been taking the piss for years, relieving rich lawyers, bankers and magnates, industrial and advertising, of their money… in substantial amounts… and good on him!

A prime example of such an offense is the whole meme about "back in the 70's, scientists used to think we were about to have an ice age!" In truth, of 49 papers published between 1965 and 1979 which predicted global climate change, 42 predicted global warming while only 7 predicted a coming ice age. Why the ice age theory caught on in the mainstream press is not immediately obvious. Perhaps the authors of the 7 ice age papers were just more vocal (notably, 4 of those 7 papers were from just a single author who in later years became a very vocal global warming skeptic), but just as likely is that an imminent ice age simply sounds more sensational than a little spot of toasty weather. Either way, it's hurt the long-term credibility of climate science...but I'll save that for another rant.

Today as the weather was pants windy and very grey we all decided to go to Ashby-de-la Zouch. After much deliberation and checking on the internet we arrived outside the Globe pub to wait. Betty said the bus was due at 10.25 I thought is was due at 10.16, sure enough a bus going in the opposite direction arrived at 10.16 and then promptly arrived back at 10.25 so your guess is as good as mine who was right. Once again everyone said hello and the driver asked us if we were on a boat on in a caravan.( There is a caravan club site at the back of the pub). It only took about 20 minutes to get to Ashby and it is a pleasant little town not too much going on but we had lunch out and then caught the 1 o'clock bus back having the same driver who brought us. As there doesn't seem to be any designated bus stops in Snarestone you just ding the bell when when you want to get off. Just as we got back to the boat it started to rain yet again hopefully tomorrow will be a bit better and we will return from whence we came. Moored near us are Bob and Rachael nb Nomad Dream needless to say while I was out the men talked engines.

So, I think it started as a dream. I was working in a security team in my old school, but it was a new building, completely rebuild, yet it had the old layout before the refurbishment intact, still the corridors led to new rooms and stairs were there were no stairs before. Like in a dream, actually. Everything is the same, yet different, yet still the same.

As a kid, one of my most vivid memories of Christmas is of my Dad digging out his impressive collection of Christmas albums. My father was at sea with the Merchant Navy for around 16 years (from the age of 16 until 32), and picked up many of his records when docking at places like the USA (New York was always the best place for records he tells me) and Canada (import albums in the 50's were virtually impossible to get hold of) . He had festive albums by all the classics - Nat King Cole, Perry Como, Andy Williams, Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Tony Bennett etc and I have since bought them all up on CD over the years. But the album I have the fondest memories of is the 1958 Johnny Mathis LP "Merry Christmas". In the last couple of years it has finally been released on CD (in fact I now have no less than 14 Christmas albums by Mathis!). In his 'guest editor' post a few weeks back, E.F Rice made some interesting observations, where music can take you right back to the past. Well even now, hearing that album (in fact just looking at the cover) takes me right back to those special Christmases of the 70's, and memories of those people I miss so much today.

So after unboxing your kit you’re left with a torso, legs, a couple of shoulder pieces, and a host of heads and arms to personalize your warjack. The first thing I did, and having had the experience of building and painting the metal starter box, was to pose the model in a way only the plastic kit would. I decided to make him stepping over a big rock, therefore I cut part of the left foot to make it bent. Placed the rock, dryfitted my legs to make sure everything was in place, and cut and glued the foot piece in place. After that I glued the legs to the base.

To say that Jane Jameson had a hard time adjusting to being a vampire is an understatement. Aunt Jettie haunts her home (used to be hers), her older sister hates her (always has), her best friend forever’s mom will NOT give up on Zeb and Jane marrying (he’s in love with a werewolf) and then there’s Gabriel…hunk, 150 yr-old vampire who turned Jane as she lay dying (and that’s a great tale in itself!). His frenemy Dick – they were childhood friends – puts anyone thief you can name to shame and her co-worker Andrea was a blood-surrogate.

To show my gratitude towards my followers, I'd like to give everyone the opportunity to win ONE of my digital stamps of choice! I will give you each a number in the order that you appear on the followers list starting at the bottom *Please note, followers who are faceless automatically show up at the beginning of the list (so numbers will be given as I see fit). My goal is to reach 100 followers. The first 25 followers will be the first batch entered into the contest. The next draw will be from 1 to 50 followers, and then 1 to 75, and finally 1 to 100! So the earlier you become a follower, the more chances you have to win! Keep checking back to see the list grow, I wouldn't want you to miss the random draw. Waiting is gonna be the hard part. So...if you want this list to grow quickly, you will have to tell your digital stamp loving friends to follow too! :) If you do not claim your prize within 3 days, I will have to do a redraw! Sorry, those are the rules. I will be updating this post with follower names and numbers. Don't panic if your name doesn't show up right away. Are you ready?

Listening to her describe their relationship is difficult. When I knew him only as the guy that’s obsessed with her, that she keeps telling it isn’t going to happen, it was much easier to make fun of him. Now, though, he just sounds pitiful and desperate...in love with someone that uses him without even fully realizing that’s what she’s doing. Now he just sounds like me, in the not so distant past. You can tell someone it isn’t going to happen all day long, but why should they believe you if you keep saying it with your pants down?

Thing is, and not a little ironically, the singer whose songs have the strongest sonic connection to UK bass is also the most pop, Katy B, where the hard-hitting drums and wobbler bass effects are sweetened by her I-wanna-be-a-star delivery. Meanwhile, dubstep fans, juiced on the weird rhythmic experiments of his early singles, have been scratching their heads trying to figure out why James Blake's album so firmly lashed itself to the mast of indie-crooner culture. And in the middle, we have Jamie Woon.

I'm still not sure about what got me started on light and bioluminescence. I remember first reading an article about it in 2007 so it's been an interest of mine for ages. I knew I wanted to write about it, and to write about television, and about big ideas and silly ideas and things that seemed too far-fetched and wonderful to be true.
The Hunger Games was the last movie I watched in the cinemas. I took my little sister who is a fan of the trilogy. I haven’t written about the Hunger Games for different reasons.

As Irene headed away from the centre of town, it became quieter. She came to a place where there were no people, no birds in the trees, only dead leaves and litter blowing along the street. As she neared the house her pace slowed; ahead of her was the one silence she couldn’t control. In the now-empty rooms, only the walls would echo her strident views, and only the mirrors would see her frown.
There's still boatloads to do, after all, it's a quite an undertaking to set up an automated brewery that will triple the size of the one that has been producing 15,000 barrels of beer annually for a while now.

While I’m taking pretty good care of my maintenance currently (good nutrition, good exercise, emotional balance, etc.), I had more than two decades of NOT maintaining my body in the fashion that was necessary. Quite frankly, as I look back upon that time period, I realize that I had many breakdowns along the way. This has me thinking, that my upcoming annual physical examination will likely yield different results than the past several I’ve had. I wonder how much restoration work I’ve done… I know I feel MUCH better, I have way more energy and can do things that I’ve not been able to do in years (including tying my tennis shoes without having to prop them up on something – see an earlier post about “The Hangover”).

Maybe you haven't watched mecha anime, its a niche where the writers of newer robot shows grew up on beloved classic robot shows and inject their writing with homages to those classics. Gurren Lagann is the best example of that, an enjoyable stand-alone show made better by tons of homages to Getter Robo and many Gainax anime. While younger fans enjoyed it for the show itself, older fans found a deeper enjoyment in all the references. Before calling out a rip off, consider the context. (ex: Scales' back story flashback to his origin is an homage to Killer Croc's original origin (before he got re-written a bunch), brought to life in a fun way. "No cake for you!")

As impressive as the many sights were, I think the people and culture I encountered had the greatest impact on me. Over the 7 days in the country, I never met anyone that wasn’t polite or helpful. Most evenings I had supper in pubs, yet I never ran across loud, obnoxious drunkards. It took me awhile to competently drive on the left side of the road, and in the meanwhile I made several rookie mistakes that created hazards, or at least impediments, for other drivers, but I never was the recipient of any reaction remotely close to the road rage that is so prevalent in the states. As a whole, the culture with which I interacted seemed to be comprised of regular, unpretentious folks that couldn’t have been more hospitable. I may never have the pleasure of returning to Ireland, but I will always remember how welcome I felt as a visitor to their remarkable land.

This works somewhere in the eastern states. Over here, in Western Australia aka The State of the Worst Drivers Ever To Be Given A License, it doesn’t work. They’re so fucking dumb here that they are the asses who cut people off. Seriously. Even better is they brake when traffic is merging into their lane, rather than keeping the flow going nicely they actually brake to a near standstill ON THE FREEWAY to let the cars just come on in. What the fuck?!?! I have drawn numerous diagrams for friends here on how you’re meant to merge, as well as ranted and raved at them when they still don’t get it. Unfortunately there’s a whole state of shitty dumbfuck drivers here that just don’t get it.
One of the best things about having your friends know that you "do furniture" is that they always call you before they dump off their trash to the DI or Goodwill. My sweet neighbor gave me two little nightstands a while back and I finally did something with them this week.

First President Obama told us that removing the 5% of the world’s oil supply that was provided by Iran with his “sanctions,” which are for the purpose of stopping Iran from doing something that it isn’t doing anyway, would not affect the price of oil. We all know how that turned out.
Paramount renamed the animation house "Famous Studios." While veterans of Fleischer Studios would be placed in charge of the studio, it is generally agreed by animation historians that the quality of Famous Studios' work would be dramatically less than that of Fleischer Studios. Much of this was due to the fact that Paramount downsized the studio a great deal, cutting both the staff and the budgets of animated shorts. While the popular Popeye cartoons would continue for years, the costly Superman shorts would be ended a year after Paramount took over Fleischer Studios. Famous Studios would introduce its own characters who would go onto become famous in their own right. Casper the Friendly Ghost, Herman & Katnip, Baby Huey, and Little Audrey were all characters who emerged in Famous Studios' cartoons. The studio also licensed popular comic strip character Little Lulu for successful series of cartoons.

The Evolution of Culture is a long and drawn out process. Theorists have debated exactly what culture is, how it arises, how it evolves, and how it is transmitted. Not by Genes Alone, How Culture Transformed Human Evolution by Richerson and Boyd, is a great book for some insight on these topics since there won't be debating here. Culture can have several meanings, including (from Wikipedia) 1) High culture - sophisticated taste in fine arts or humanities. 2) an integrated pattern of human knowledge, belief, and behavior that depends upon the capacity for symbolic thought and social learning or 3) the set of shared attitudes, values, goals, and practices that characterizes an institution, organization or group. For purposes of this article, I'll be focusing only on the third definition of the word culture.
When libertarians and conservative talk about the knowledge problems markets fix, they are not wrong. This lead to a logic of defending the early liberal revolutions from Marx and later Marxists are necessary steps. This is also what justifies and justified Chinese and Soviet State capitalism as necessary development since no liberal society produced a revolution that was not betrayed by liberal/social democratic forces. Red Rosa was killed by shock troops–proto-fascists–who were invited into the briefly existing revolutionary states by Social Democrats.
So this was my fourth (or fifth?) attempt at the briolette flower.

If I want a story of sexual obsession, I’ll dig up a copy of 9 and 1/2 Weeks. At the time it was released, I was in college and experimenting with my own sexuality. It was fascinating and erotic and fun, and then got scary and I won’t spoil the ending. Mickey Rourke in his heyday is fantastically sexy and yet untouchable and Basinger puts on a fantastic performance.
On other fronts, we also tackled parent/teacher conference this week.

Humanity is a funny creation. We have a tendency to shift with time. We have a tendency to change, yet, claim that we do not. Think about that. We even lie to ourselves. Eventually, we will come to the conclusion that we have changed, but only reluctantly. I honestly think that we admit that we have changed because of our change in physical abilities. When we were young enough to be able to stay up all night, we thought nothing of it. As we grow older, and our stamina has diminished, we may find ourselves saying that old saying that “Nothing good happens after midnight.”

Now this has a very thin formula so if you have a lot to cover this may not work for you. But due to its consistency it does make it easy to blend as it just sinks into my skin. I do not set it with a powder and it last me a whole day at uni without any caking whatsoever. I use the applicator directly onto my face and either blend with my fingers or use my foundation brush and love the results. Overall, this is definitely a light to medium coverage concealer perfect for on the go and if your not looking for any heavy duty concealing. This is definitely a repurchase in the concealer deparment for me, however I do have others im testing out so stay tuned for more reviews to come.

I have not been 'here' in a while. April held a whammy for me. Beginning the first day, I got a terrible flu and was, quite literally, down for the count. I 'lost' two solid weeks, so sick that I could barely even play on my ipad (so you KNOW that was bad!) Anyway, I am much better now and back almost to 100% although I still have a cough that seems will linger for a while. I have missed Paint Party Fridays and blogging and posting on my Etsy shop, I hope to get back into the swing of things and have lots of new ideas and art to share with you soon!!
But here’s the upshot, and where the critical thinking, come in: I then remove the board to reveal a thick slab of copper metal underneath, and I tell the participant to repeat the demonstration. The results are exactly the same! Thus, through a simple application of Occam’s Razor, one can easily conclude the obvious: the Ouija board has nothing to do with the observed phenomenon.

Alan said he had hoped to incorporate Cino's ideas into the Ironman design but WSI nixed the idea in favor of designing it after the already successful Comp TA, another project of Alan's.

The Penguins just looked like they couldn't keep up. We came back to win Game 4 at 10-3 and Game 5 at 3-2. But then we dropped the ball and lost the all important Game 6 at 5-1. We were out of the playoffs.

Today I started my morning by dropping Ned to day care and then I took the most beautiful walk around the Harbour. I really walked hard and up and down some of the massive hills and old stone staircases we have around here. It was a really good 50 minute workout.
A few years later, I had the opportunity to work at a much larger church as a volunteer with a fantastic group of youth led by one of my favorite youth ministers ever. I followed that year up with being the intern for the summer—and once again loved the work I did and the people with whom I did it. Once again, the church was not without its issues. But it worked.
Which brings me to the current big bad, Alaric (or Evilaric) (played by Matt Davis). Really, there was nowhere to go with Alaric’s character. The secret about his ex-wife was out and he had moved on to become a parental figure to Elena (Nina Dorev) and Jeremy (Steven R. McQueen).
Since he'd abandoned his tribe, in search of something better. Something he still hadn't found, and was starting to doubt even existed.
The only avenue of initiation is through Jesus Christ and His work on the cross. Remember the words of the Lord in John 14:6. “No one cometh unto the Father but by me.” God is doing His part by inviting men and women to accept the offer of salvation. It is now up to man to claim that work on the cross and the empty tomb.

p153-4 “…it is not inadmissible to think of an epoch, and an epoch not too far distant, when humanity to ensure its survival, will find itself reduced to desisting from any further ‘making’ of history in the sense in which it began to make it from the creation of the first empires, will confine itself to repeating prescribed archetypal gestures, and will strive to forget, as meaningless and dangerous, any spontaneous gesture which might entail ‘historical’ consequences.”

I read through all the fibro info on this Johns Hopkins site, and I was really impressed and comfortable with the info they provide, it seems very relevant, current and accurate. Please take the time to read through their site, I have provided below some good examples of the info and details they discuss.
Tinariwen — which means “empty spaces” or “deserts” in its Tuareg tongue — has grown into an ever-evolving collective with a handful of core members, which helps its sound stay fresh. On its fifth studio release, “Tassili,” the band expands its horizons further with guest artists Tunde Adebimpe and Kyp Malone (TV on the Radio), Nels Cline (Wilco) and the Dirty Dozen Brass Band. All are musicians at the top of their creative game.”
However, while our teachers gave me the technical skills required to write well, they did not teach me the most important lesion about writing. Writing is collaborative. I came about this personal discovery in tenth grade when I stuck my neck out and asked a few of newly-made my friends to read a story I was writing (in a marble composition book, of course) and provide me with feedback. I received more information about my own writing than I ever could have come up with on my own. (I also edited my best-friend-at-the-time-Amanda’s writing in the same way—with more comments on grammar, however.) I loved seeing their reactions across the room as they read a twist or puzzle that I introduced in the story and their frustration when it did not go how they expected (or when I ended in the middle of a sentence because the bell rang). We often did not pay attention in Chemistry, or Economics, or even English class, choosing instead to read and write our stories.
Happy Fall Y'all!
Lord, You are God of all, and all the world in its fullness is Yours. Help us to be people who advance Your will, not those who hinder it. Don’t let our ways, our education, our doctrines get in the way of how You may choose to work. May we not be so rigid or stubborn that we miss what You’re doing, Holy Spirit. Give us a fresh vision of Your Kingdom and aid our imaginations in finding creative solutions to bring freedom, hope, and love to Your world. It is by Your love and grace that our lives are true testimonies of Your ability to use anyone. We continue the cry of Isaiah: send us, Lord, send us. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, Amen.

As we join in His march of Victory, we must always keep in mind, brethren, that although the Ultimate Work of Grace on the Cross, is perfect and complete in Christ through eternity – it is only through a continuously active Faith that we can appropriate and bring the eternal graces of that Victory into manifestation in our lives – that is, into this natural space-time continuum in which we exist! That is why we must Let Love Reign in our hearts in all that we think or do or say.
I picked up this excellent Lp this past weekend knowing absolutely nothing about the band, however I did notice that this record was on the Guardian label who also brought us the might Mythra.

On Monday I drove home from work convinced Kamel didn't love me anymore. Why you ask? Because I was on my period. And no matter what anyone says - hormones have much to do with life, and can make normally sane people, crazy. So when I got home that day I crawled into bed and played Super Mario Brothers on the DS, still fully clothed, and waited for Kamel to come home.

Somewhere on the far side of the vale beyond that grim scarp, Van Raighan fled with his secrets. Notia was saying something, but Pevan blocked her out, reached for the nook at the back of her mind where she'd stored the memory of the previous gate. She cringed at the throb of her head as she spun the final Gate in the sequence, but it opened in the untamed grass at their feet without a hitch.
2. A lying tongue. Gossip. Gossip is idle talk or rumour about the personal affairs of others. A friend of mine once uttered these words,” I am a ballroom dancer and I was born to judge. That’s right, I’m judging you.” Like complaining, I really shouldn’t do it. Yet, I can’t help myself. Things are happy, things are great and yet, someone just took my coke can away. I need to complain about this pronto. Gossip is terrible right? But appears to be my divine right. In good times and bad times, I just do it, as if it has a purpose, because I think it does.

When I was seventeen I walked into a locker room where a bunch of older boys were holding down a freshman and shoving his wet underwear in his nose and mouth. Apparently they saw pee stain on his tighty whiteys and decided to humiliate him. (And why NOT? He was younger, a little chubby, and quickly started to cry pitifully. What fun, right?)
Sometimes I borrow half a dozen movies from the library spend Friday night kicking off a weekend of watching them all. Other times I borrow half a dozen movies and decide to ignore them and not watch any at all! I spend many a Friday night catching up on DVR-ed TV shows, reading chapters upon chapters of books, or playing Tetris until my thumbs are sore. Other Friday nights I take a bubble bath, paint my toenails, or putter around the house with beauty potions and pastes on my skin and in my hair.

But the place where we are is, surprisingly, the place of love and peace after all; since the death of Christ defied even the worst consequences of our human decisions, and the Resurrection, the ‘being-raised’, of Christ insisted that our worst and most perverse and most idiotic decisions could still be outbid, outplayed, by the most insightful and most committed of human beings, in whose body and soul God our Father flooded a human sterility with a divine vitality. Love outmanoeuvred death, after all.
Racism is still here. I don’t know of anyone in America that knows this more than black males. Racism is just a part of life…for us. It was and is just part of the journey. No big deal.

Cally has some advice for anyone thinking of writing a novel. 'I’m not much of a plotter,' she says. 'I tend to know the beginning and the ending and let the characters tell me how to get there. But breaking your idea into chapters can be helpful as it reduces it to manageable chunks. Try not to be over-awed by how long a novel is and set yourself little targets like “I’ll write 500 words today,” or “I’m going to keep writing until I finish this scene”. Writing is such a solitary business that joining a writing group can be helpful too. You can swap notes with other writers, encourage each other to keep going or even challenge each other to write a certain number of words by a certain date.'
One day, a commercial came on for engagement rings, and I casually asked her, “Mom, do you remember when Dad proposed to you?” Suddenly her eyes lit up, as if I had unlocked a long-forgotten memory that brought her great joy. She proceeded to tell me the proposal story in great detail, which was more than I had heard her talk in weeks. I discovered Mom retained many vivid recollections of her past, and she seemed delighted to tell me her stories. All I had to do was ask a good question.
And, in this passage, he is a stranger. I watch the painting form in purely technical terms, interpret its steps in light of its end instead of understanding his work in the moment. My experience as a visual artist leads me to different conclusions about those paintings now—he was doing what seemed right. He wanted them perfect. They may have been the closest he came to perfection in his sloppy life, and the additional layers of paint and scrubbed colors evinced desperate hope, not the inevitable disappointment I assigned them then. When they felt finished, he stopped. Perhaps he couldn’t tell how good they were at all. Maybe time had to tell that.

Not really, but that’s because I’ve not told anyone. Really, I haven’t. I’ve kept it a secret from everyone. But if I have to say if something’s changed, my heart rate has definitely doubled since then. Instead of “beat-beat” I now have a “be-be-a-bea-t-beat.” Don’t get me wrong, I seriously thought it was a joke. There wasn’t anything like a surprise party or some old guy walking up to me saying “Surprise!” while I was putting on my helmet. But I’m honored beyond words.

We got a few hours kip in a fairly posh resort (too fancy for a bunch of fishing journo’s) before leaving for Keppeluna Marina. Awaiting was a 40 ft catamaran owned by a guy who had copious amounts of cash and hospitality to match. Coffees, breakfast, lunch, freshly caught fish… this dude had it covered. It wasn’t until later however that we discovered Tourism Queensland paid $2,500 for the service.
So, Christina and I have decided that we’re no longer going to buy refined sugar. Either by itself or as an ingredient in anything. No doubt this will be difficult, but “nothing worth doing is ever easy” as the saying goes. It will probably take us a month or so just to go through all the stuff in our house that does have sugar (I doubt I can convince Christina to throw it out), but after that, I’m hoping never to buy sugar again. I’m not sure how to handle the kids yet though. Obviously, they won’t be eating anything with sugar in it at home, but what about outside the home? It’s my hope that as they grow up, we can teach them that the benefits from living without it far outweighs the momentary enjoyment they might get, and that they will decide for themselves to stay away from sugar. But right now, that’s a little beyond their grasp. I guess our options are:

Silent Scream is the latest hardback from Karen Rose. It starts with an arson that goes wrong as an innocent young girl is killed. The four college students who set the fight thought that awful night was over with but someone else was there that night – someone who is not going to let them forget.
I'm lucky that the public dental services in my area are really good. These services can really vary a lot in availability according to where you live, I have found. I had been to this clinic before to get my wisdom teeth removed. Everyone there is really friendly and professional, and the individuals work together as a team well. So, when a piece of one of my molars broke off last week, leaving a sharp edge, I called them straight away. Well, once business hours started. It helps to have these things happen on a weekday.

I get the idea that your job is no fun. But why? This is an important question. It could be that it's just not fun, what you do, like being a public defender. No fun and low pay. But perhaps a great sense of fulfillment.
There are all kinds of ways to think about those books. My favourite approach is to treat them as the equivalent of gateway drugs. If someone is buying a book like Arthus-Bertrand’s Earth from Above isn’t it possible that that person then might be interested in other photobooks? By those books Colberg means the likes of Anne Geddes or Artus-Bertrand (of Earth From Above)—the kind of books you find in your local Barnes & Noble. Gateway drugs? So Anne Geddes might be a gateway to Anouk Kruithof? I suppose it's possible. Shall we also say that JCPenney's is the gateway to becoming a hipster? Tintin comics a gateway to Proust? It could happen.
The cure? A short skirt.
The thing I liked most about this novel was the humor. The author throws humor into the oddest situtaions, and the laughs are creative, and you definitely don't see them coming. The plot was creative as well, fast-paced and not horribly complicated, but just complicated enough to where it kept you guessing. The main characters was a spunky, realistic heroin who was tough but not too tough, and who I felt like I could relate to -- and her "love interest" (not too much of an interest in this book, but will probably grow to be one in the next book(s) Morelli was a great character with an almost familiar charm.
This is a recipe that I don’t have exact measurements for. I usually go by what I feel is enough of one particular spice or another. I will give you the ingredients, approximate amounts I use and approximate time for baking them but you can adjust and improve to your taste. Also, being cooked in the oven you don’t have to worry about a grill or smoker.
* Place water, egg, tang zhong (use 75g), sugar, salt, bread flour, cake flour, milk powder in the pan of the bread machine (according to the sequence as stated in the instruction manual of your bread machine). Make an indentation on the flour and add in the instant yeast. Select the Dough function of the bread machine and press start. Leave the lid of the machine open (this is to prevent over heating). After about 10mins of kneading, add in the 45g of butter. Let the machine continue to knead the dough. After the kneading cycle has stopped (20mins), Stop and Restart the machine. Continue to let the machine knead for another 20mins. Remove dough from the bread pan.

The story goes that this took place after it was discovered that the arch was too narrow for the widest of the new-fangled coaches but there are some doubts over this, particularly as the gold state coach passed under it during Queen Elizabeth II’s coronation in 1952.

Hutchison’s writing style and natural humour and wit reminded me a lot of Terry Pratchett and Garth Nix. I was smiling throughout the story because the characters themselves are so well written and come out with some cracking lines.
How I hated having a Dutch name, which might (horror of horrors!) have labelled me a "Boer" - especially as my father consorted with people like the Duke of Connaught, I had an aunt who had been presented at court, and, as a member of a Brownie pack, I had once proudly seen my father welcome Lord and Lady Clarendon on the steps of our Town Hall. Flags hung at half-mast and all places of business were closed on the day of my father's death.

One-year anniversary of the death of OBL. President Obama does an ad to highlight that the successful raid took place during his administration. Sparks off controversy as his opponents, the Republicans, decry this move. Thing is, under George W Bush’s re-election campaign, they were doing the same thing to the then Democratic presidential candidate, John Kerry. And then some. So it’s okay for you to do it, but not for your opponent?

So unlike yesterday
It was a marvel to watch Queen City literally set up for the evening from scratch to finish in what would be a sold-out bout; volunteers everywhere, laying down the track, ticket sellers, ticket takers, crew installing lights overhead into the ceiling, putting out the bleachers, handle a session for the entire league photo, photo mediator B-17 dealing with press, the ongoing Queen’s Court chitchat, zebras and roster boards, a bake sale setup for the Ice Ice Babies who are the Queen City Roller Girls junior team, a band setup and stage for half time intermission, merchandise table, concession and food, stats table, scoreboard table, power bars, putting up sponsors banners including Mighty Taco, setting out the players benches and penalty bin, video crew in the form of Mr. Fit, Mama Chops out to handle the after-party setup for her ladies, players and teams rolling in to get changed and warming up on the track, it was indeed the universal experience of game day. All thanks to the biggest fan of the league who would be the owner of Rainbow Roller Rink. While all this unfolded around me, what had accrued from the experience of travelling on the road or even being at home amongst the leagues in and around Toronto and the grand experience of Blood and Thunder World Cup, was more than an enabler in knowing how to deal and what questions to ask. Where to shoot. How to shoot. In other words: How to fit in.

Now, I've been reading about the Law of Attraction for close to 20 years but have never managed to make any real changes in my life. I've used positive thinking, and written down affirmations, and made gratitude lists, and created vision boards, and practiced feng shui, and none of it ever really made much of a difference. I've been stuck in the same crappy job for 16 years, been living in the same tiny house for 20, and still apparently haven't learned a damn thing about attracting a healthy relationship. Obviously there was something I wasn't getting.

Like I’m sure is the case with many people, whether they choose to admit it or not, whenever there’s a new reality TV show cropping up on the ol’ box, no matter how strong my intention is to, I always somehow manage to get sucked into it eventually. The latest one to grace our screens has been The Voice. Originally airing in the US, the show has been brought over to the UK and is enjoying a riotous boom of popularity, as judges Jessie J, Tom Jones, will.i.am & The Script‘s Danny O’Donoghue rely on what they hear rather than what they can see to complete their teams of ten. Whilst the show is still peppered with the typical sob stories used to whip up an emotional storm from viewers at home, I do at least commend the format for at least focusing on what really matters here: the voice, and not the ‘full package‘, as that industry tyrant Simon Cowell so pathetically calls it, which means the singer has to have a face for magazines, not for the radio.

Itching may occur if the infected people becomes susceptible to antigenic constituents of saliva that lice inject simultaneously supply your head. After feeding the insects generally live in an ambush near the hair until you get hungry again. Then you can in addition pick home remedies such as olive oil, alone or in combination with essential oils, or vinegar. Head lice are becoming harder to destroy. You will feel something itchy on your head now and then.
On the whole, audiences tend to perceive more easily aspects that may not be included on the original purposes of the artist, things like: walking, breathing, coughing; unavoidable characteristics of someone recording. Maybe is a sound failure while taking the record but I like to think that is a deliberate act and a personal sound signature of the artist.
"Most powerful" is very hard to define as well, because you've got both mass, and velocity to account for; and the standard objective power metric of "muzzle energy", isn't necessarily a good predictor of combat, defensive, or hunting effectiveness.
It took me a few chapters to really get into this book. However, once I did I was swept into the world of balls, carriage rides, and Sunday visiting hours. While not overly heavy with historical facts, there is enough history thrown in to appease most readers. Mentions of Gramercy Park, Admiral Dewey, and the corruption that ran rampant in NYC politics at the time serve as a subtle backdrop for the scandalous lives of the main characters. I do wish the setting played a bigger part in the story. At times, it felt like the setting was merely background and the story could have been taking place anywhere, at anytime. Godbersen has an opportunity to really make NYC an important character, if you will, and I hope she takes advantage of that.

What do you find you need to remind yourself to do?
The goal of parenting is not to produce good children, but good adults. The good child is marked by docility, the good adult by character. The word discipline comes from the word disciple. Discipline, therefor is not punishment. Children are not Pavlov's dogs, to be be programmed with rewards and punishments. They are human beings, persons of infinite worth and dignity. They deserve not only to be treated as persons, but to know that we regard them as persons, that we value them, their intellects, their wills, their feelings, their desires, their needs, their judgments as much as we would have them value ours.
In the days prior to meeting Glen, he proved to be the perfect fur-child parent. He asked all the right questions about Abbey's habits, lifestyle, and likes/dislikes. He asked about her training and what made her tick. He asked about the best way to handle her fears and anxiety. He cared... already... and tremendously... we loved him.
I hope this finds you well!

Stitch Idees (Vol. 11, samples shown above) is another Japanese embroidery magazine available for download. Less for the beginner and more challenging, this magazine provides an array of projects and patterns suitable for sweet lovers as well as classic lolitas or those more inclined to natural-kei or morigirl style. Lace cutwork collars, 3D satin-stitched pillboxes, and fairytale-like traditional cross-stitch patterns of red birds adorn the pages. Some of these projects may be hard to discern from the Japanese pages if you're not familiar with advanced embroidery such as Hardanger, ribbonwork, or beadwork.
Now if anybody had seen me at half past five sat in the chair, head nodding – you know the way I mean – when your chin banging on your chest wakes you up, they would have never have believed that less than an hour later I would be out running.

Later in the series I will talk about leaving the idea of the job behind. Of what true skills mean and how they protect us. Of how to look for work instead of a job.
His analysis may just explain how brilliant Indian scientists are being intellectually suffocated in India.
Sarah and I met through a writing competition (Undiscovered Voices). She was one of the judges and I one of the fortunate winners. That was back in the day when 'Devil's Kiss' was still called 'God's Killer'. We met and chatted and soon after I joined Greenhouse Literary Agency. At that point the Greenhouse comprised me and Sarah and her dog.
The less-than-peaceful times roll through like summer storms, and we are all getting better, now, at letting them wash over us without sweeping us away....

Today's photo safari is special because the awesome Eryl, from the "Kitchen bitch ponders", joined in on the fun! Eryl, F, and I each contributed a theme, which were "Change", "Mundane", and "Vital", and over the course of two weeks we each took a shot for each theme.
You have to wonder though, what about the victims who might not able to look forward to the years ahead if their life, faith, families and chance of functional relationships have been destroyed how is Cardinal Brady’s going to comfort them?
If we look at “Art Exhibitions Websites” as a keyword string we find the creme de la creme in terms of Art Galleries, Museums and other Art institutions competing for top positions – in fact over 165,000,000 ! Plus tons of Google Ads over many pages.
‘You hurt and disappoint me, Jeeves,’ I said, sipping a couple of sips and getting suaver all the time. ‘I could understand your attitude if the object under advisement were something bushy and waxed at the ends like a sergeant-major’s, but it is merely the delicate wisp of vegetation with which David Niven has for years been winning the applause of millions. When you see David Niven on the screen, you don’t recoil in horror, do you?’

V6 is also fascinating: (From the ESV Study Bible) “From Antioch in Pisidia, Paul and Timothy travel far northward, and then westward. Natural human wisdom would have led them to think they should preach the gospel in all the cities that they passed through, but instead the Holy Spirit directed them on a 400-mile journey by foot to Troas. They must have had a strong sense of the Spirit’s direct guidance and concluded that he would guide others to preach the gospel in the northern regions of Asia.”

Smile, be brave and know that you have given God a precious gift. You have given Him the gift of your youth and beauty. The amazing thing about God is that He will not be outdone in generosity. He'll take that gift you've given Him and transform it into the most amazing gift you've ever known. In the blink of an eye you're going to see your children grow up and become beautiful and handsome, strong and full of youthful vigor. Some of them might even get married and someday have children of their own. Your gift of youth and beauty will be multiplied many times over as each generation repeats the giving.
He lived up to his controversial reputation Tuesday, describing himself as a “self-hating Israeli Jew” and comparing Israeli policy to Nazism.
I tried heating it up and whipping it again, but it was a complete loss. That's all right...I felt a little odd about eating so much butter, anyway. I made a basic cream cheese frosting instead.
Indeed, whether or not I loved the final product, I still have tremendous respect for Jacobs’ mission, which I would have probably given up on by about the letter B. The Know-It-All is also an easy enough book to read. Because Jacobs essentially jots down anecdotes as he goes through different Britannica entries, there are plenty of stopping places. In fact, The Know-It-All might make an adequate, if somewhat ironic, bathroom book (so might the Britannica itself, for that matter).

He not only provided us with beer (which we greatly appreciate), but some entertaining quotes. When a suspicious man wearing a large backpack (an obvious HBG stalker) entered the bar, without missing a beat Joel stated, "He's hear to kill us all!" If you didn't find that funny, you obviously weren't drinking three buck Indiana beers all night.
If the projections hold, the $423 million spent by the Sheriff’s Office in the year that ends Feb. 28 would be 14 percent more than Commissioners Court planned when it passed the county budget last year.
Years ago, I owned an herb nursery called Lost Prairie Herb Farm which shipped live herb plants all over the US. One of my very favorite plants was creeping thyme, of which there are many varieties, and I loved them all. This one provides a dense carpet which, starting this time of year, covers itself with breathtaking deep-pink/purple flowers. Exquisite! It's just beginning that process right now.
Perhaps you noticed the theme here: many food makers are taking advantage of your desire to make healthy food choices by selling you “healthy” food options that are actually no better than the junk you are trying to abandon. To protect yourself, always read the labels and learn to separate facts from jargon.

From the seniors to the youngsters everyone loves to wear watches. The contemporary technology and options have increased the choices for the people to select their watches according to their needs and the style preferences. There were times, when the watches were generally worn by the men, however as women started to work, plenty of options in the watches started emerging in the world markets.
It turns out that the standard, which may have been intended primarily to prevent a person accused of adultery from being executed without extraordinary evidence, is so demanding that a non-sharia based-law is used to punish rape, with much less severe punishments, in many Muslim countries. The reported rape rates in Muslim countries are so astonishingly low that I am inclined to think that these crimes are just not being reported.I felt I needed to expand greatly on my previous comment about rape and shame in the islamic world:
If you havent already started to watch this show, I suggest you really should. Theflyinglap.com, is a webcast and audio download going out every Wednesday at 6pm UK time. Peter Windsor runs this show from a studio in London. He’s had guests as varied as Frank Williams to John Surtees, Willem Toet and Sergio Rinland on the technical side. The show is an hour of live F1 chat with journalist and people within F1, often with aftershow chat continuing for upto an hour after the live show. the show is then available from smibs.tv, youtube and available as a free I-tunes download.

Reading this next for my English class. Very excited, since I've always wanted to read Hamlet.
Prospero, privileged among men, has a daughter Miranda. Both are meshed in a world of wealth, comfort and servants, removed from the rigours of life, as we know it. At the dead of night everything ceases to be. Father and child exiled. Put to sea.

One of the common traits of human behaviour I seem to encounter regularly is that of not visiting tourist attractions if they happen to be on our own doorstep. From time to time I visit friends around the UK and ask them questions about local cathedrals, museums, galleries or monuments near their home. Very often the response is along the lines of “Oh, well……we’ve never actually been there ourselves, but we’d be delighted to go with you!”.

Young female motorists have been disappearing around this area. We find out that they are being misdirected with this detour barrier (like in 2000 MANIACS) that leads them to a spooky old mansion where a mysterious Dr. Marlowe and his 'dead' wife live.
It is a very common side effect from brain surgery, to develop a condition called Aphasia. Marissa's condition is more of a moderate Broca Aphasia. Basically, everything she knows and has learned her entire life, is still inside the brain- but her mouth is having a hard time pronouncing those things. It's just a dissconnection from brain directing the mouth what to say. SO TRUST ME she definitely doesn't need anything watered down for her, she just needs understanding from people around her. She is still our spicy little Marissa- she just has to push thru the after effects of such a large surgery.
Well, the answer to a lot of your questions will be answered - okay, so my hope, prayer, desire and goal is that they will be answered in Abby and Basil's NEVERLOVE. This story has actually taken me by surprise. YOU all have taken me by surprise. Your interest, your reactions, your comments touched my heart. I never told anyone, but a few times I actually just smiled and shed a few tears. Although I haven't published this novel as of yet, I can truly see the soulful boon from putting out a story readers WANT to read.
On a side note: I made my first "French joke" last week.
I used a strip showing the backside of each paper to cover the space at the bottom that didn't get covered by the first piece I glued down. All I did was cut the paper 9" across. It was leftover paper from another project. I'm not sure what the length was. lol! But it left about an inch and a half at the bottom of the clipboards. I just cut a notch out of the top to accomodate the clippy part of the clipboard and Mod Podged it to the board. Can't wait to add some of the kids' artwork to it!

Until 1996 there were 54 textile mills in Mumbai: 51 composite mills and 3 spinning. Of these 25 were in the state sector, being nationalized mills, and the rest were in private hands. The National Textile Corporation (NTC) had been formed after the nationalization of mills by the Indira Gandhi govt, in 1974. The idea of nationalization was to protect jobs and save the industry from sickness. Now however, NTC is behaving in exactly the same way as the private owners, in lack of accountability, real estate profiteering and outright fraud. In fact the NTC did not even want to follow the DCR and give a part of the land to the city and for common purposes, even if they were being given equal land outside the island city in exchange.

Mirdza Kempe was a well known Latvian poet and Eriks Adamsons was a famous writer, her former husband and on and off lover. Janis Berzinsh was a nobody. I wished I was filing away index cards of my own objects sporting famous people’s sperm spots and had discreet lovers/admirors who would not part with the objects I had given to them as tokens of my affection.
I really do hate the two words “I’m sorry”. It’s not that easy, is it? To be able to say those two words and then expect everything to be okay. I really never could fathom how naïve we’ve become. It’s not our fault though. From the beginning whenever we made a mistake, we were asked to apologies; it was to train us to have proper manners but all it taught us was one simple motto. Make mistakes and then say sorry.
Craft improvements aside for the moment, I gotta say, it was nice to be back inside the mind of Frank Trigg. At times Frank's mind can be a pretty strange, horny and awkward place, but most times it isn't that different than being inside my own. Sure, he'll make you cringe with some of his naughty thoughts, the worst of which pop up at the most inopportune times, but Frank is a pretty lovable guy, with a big heart, and after some of the events that unfold in At the Gates I'm very interested to see where his character arc goes from here on out.

E@L has been pumping the asphalt (or doing c-p stuff in the gym; HR at 125bpm or so) every day, mostly, for the last two weeks. And is off the grog. It's merely a matter of willpower, of becoming the person who you have chosen for yourself to be in the power of visualizing... yada yada. He's on a diet and a get fit kick. Maybe it's the massive negative incentive of having committed to give $5k to a cause he detest (maybe some TCM university studying how best to exterminate endangered species for fun and profit when aspirin or Viagra would work just as well - sorry, I mean would work; maybe the Scientology nutters...) if he can't knock 10% off his body-weight in three (3, count 'em) months. Bruce is holding the signed cheque and will make the decision about where the money goes. Seriously, no muckin' abart...
This week’s questions is: What book took you the longest to read, and do you feel it was the content or just the length that made it so?
I am standing stage right up by the barricade. To my right there is a large green expanse about 20 feet in diameter where no one stands. A dozen or more people have broken away from the crowd into this empty area and have made it their own private regression zone for the worship of music in their way. Hop hop, switch foot, hop hop, switch foot. It is peaceful, hypnotic even. I am not familiar with their way of appreciation, nor would I participate, but I get it. They have something to say about the music, and shouted words will not suffice.
First off… I don’t hate Justin Bieber. I don’t hate Miley Cyrus or Katy Perry or Avatar. At most, I have no real opinion at all of Bieber. I can’t name a song of his, I didn’t see his movie. My only thought about Justin Bieber is that he makes me feel old. I always have this sneaking feeling that if I were 17 I would understand his deal, and I feel like I’m so far removed from knowing his deal that it sort of depresses me.
In this first of the 19th Year Trilogy, Winn might know more about Mac than even she does, and that knowledge could end their lives, unless Mac ensures the powers-that-be have no choice but to keep him around.

The final chapter will be putting laminate flooring down just as soon as I can match what is already on the main floor of my house. This should be interesting...never installed flooring before. Then again, I haven't done a lot of the stuff that I am learning to do.
After topping it with more whipped cream and then the second layer of cake, I whipped up 3 batches of cream cheese buttercream, and set a bit of it aside (since I would be neededing white frosting). To the rest of the frosting, I added a combination of Americolor "fuschia" and "soft pink" to get the perfect color of pink. Then I did a quick crumb coat over the entire cake, and then a second smooth coating on the top. And for the sides, I piped the vertical stripe pattern with a large basketweave tip.
Now we have a strange new world to survive (and conquer), full of left-behind dangers.

Continuing on my series of rectal related reflections, I bring to you a piece of art I discovered some years ago. It's a video piece entitled: "Colon Karaoke". It utilisises a video documenting a colonoscopy being carried out on the artist, Brina Thurston.
Our family pediatrician saw Goldie that day. I requested him that day because he is so compassionate and has a quietness about him that I enjoy. The room was filled with our family of 5, the doctor and at least on medical student.
Breathing a sigh of relief, I examined its mechanisms and read the Quality Control sheet and Manufacturer Guarantee they included. Here are the facts: The table is supported by an interlocking canvas weave with a buoyant enough soft vinyl bed and face pillow; however it is pretty vulnerable. The table closes by velcro, which over time will start to wear off. If I am not careful to overly bump around while riding the subway and city transit, I could pop a hole in the vinyl of both the table and face cradle. The table can handle up to 500 lbs of body weight, BUT the larger your client is the more towards the ends (front or back) the client will have to mount the table in order to get on it because the center is its weakest point. The guarantee for the table is 5 years, but if damage happens to any of the vulnerable noted points, they will not replace the table. The face pillow is only guaranteed for a year, which is the most vulnerable of all parts because people’s faces are pressing into it for lengthy periods. The pillow can be re inflated, but the air hose for that is not included with the table.
Once they start to splutter, add the black pepper, garam masala and green peas.

The audience’s enthusiastic ovations stopped the meter at its apex, and she won the competition and was invited to return. The song was so well-received that she released it as a single. In short, although Cline had been performing for nearly a decade and had been recording and appearing on local Washington, D.C. TV for more than two years, Godfrey was largely responsible for making her a star. For a couple of months thereafter, Cline appeared regularly on Godfrey’s radio program.

Three people are drawn to the small Wyoming town for very different reasons. Anthropologist Jack Kendrick comes to explore the surrounding caves — the last place his father was seen alive twelve years ago. Police officer Elina Gutierrez follows the trail of her missing cousin from L.A. until it goes cold in the near-deserted town. And George Wilcox, a wealthy businessman, is lured to a lodge on the bluff by the promise of a cure for his wife’s illness.
Anyway, I knew I still wanted to be involved, but not in the cast. The thought also occurred to me that nobody else was stepping up to be stage manager. Perhaps without thinking too much about it, I volunteered for the position.
There was again another brief panic when I had difficulty getting the bendy pipe back on - the turny part had gotten turned too tight, and I couldn't get it back on - but my brute strength on the manly wrench pipe proved fruitful, and I finally figured it out.
1. Most cities/states have laws against living in your vehicle. Perhaps this will change as more and more people lose their homes. For many, paying rent and trying to pay down debt (student loan/credit cards) is overwhelming. I've little doubt that homelessness will be a growing issue in the years to come.

To rephrase, 3 out of 4 people in sales will never get better than they are now so stop wondering why it’s been so hard to grow your company. The only logical thing to do is to use the science of sales to evaluate your sales team right now to figure out what its potential could be and fix your sales hiring system to attract and hire the top 26% that you covet so much.

For some reason, there was an almost constant running dialog from the stage about New Orleans. Yes, there are still evacuees in Austin, and yes it's fashionable to talk about the failing of the government there. (No one ever referred to the grotesque failings of the Lousiana & NOLA local officials; to hear it from this forum GWB is responsible for everything.) Given that Obama barely brought it up, I have to wonder what purpose there was to grinding that axe.

REHEMA:
Until recently, the central role of traditional subscription-based academic journals in the scientific process seemed unassailable, but rapid changes in technology over recent years mean that new models of publishing scientific papers have become viable.
In the end, they went for a bit too much unfortunately. Not even ridiculously high - around £140 at the auction end. But it probably would have cost me nearly £200 just to go to King's Lynn in Norfolk (about 250 miles round trip), pick them up with a rented van and bring them back... and then the cost of painting them and recovering them.... yes, I could have made the money back eventually but I wasn't prepared for the initial outlay. So it didn't happen... sigh.

Local 10's pilot program is preparing workers from low-income communities for those jobs. Among other green-related skills, the program provides trainees with a hands-on introduction to green construction, energy audits, and insulation. The program also has components of construction basics such as utilizing hand and power tools, construction safety, and indoor environmental awareness. Although the pilot program will end next week, Local 10 will continue to train workers as the job market for residential energy efficiency grows.
Here’s how Mark begins the Christ story: The beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ, God’s Son …” (1:1). The next seven verses are about John the Baptist, and Jesus first appears in 1:9: “About that time, Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and John baptized him in the Jordan River.”

The holiday season is an insanely busy time in my field, which for the sake of brevity we'll call "television post-production." Production houses are notorious for waiting until the last possible minute to wrap their programs, the result being 13,000 television programs that are all clamoring to be finished before the Christmas/New Year break. This means a lot of 12-hour days and very little energy left over for making fun of advertising. Which is a shame, because this time of year really produces some truly terrible commercials.

I picked up this cute little There She Goes gnome from My Little Friend for this sketch - love all the gnomes and their sassy little sentiments. I started by stamping him in Memento Tuxedo Black ink and then colored him with Copics. I sponged around the bottom in Memento Desert Sand and added a little sponged Memento Canteloupe around the top edges. These cute papers are My Mind's Eye Lime Twist - Fly a Kite and the card size is 3-1/4" x 6-1/2". I love this size card and I never seem to make them much. That's a shame really.

Ok at this point you may be saying “But that is all Old Testament stuff, we’re under the New Testament.” Well, I could spend time showing the direct correlation of the Old and New Testaments and how they tie in. I won’t do that for the sake of brevity and it isn’t even necessary here. I am trying to demonstrate by scripture that the wrath of God is a dangerous thing for the disobedient and to also offer that while God is love and he is longsuffering, there is some kind of point where, by His nature which is to Holy and unable to tolerate unrepentant sin, He can and does take punitive action. It is also a Biblical fact that God does not change. The covenant He has made with His people did, but God and His nature did not. Malachi 3:6 says, "For I, the Lord, do not change….”

For whatever reason, the one fact about IBD that I have stuck in my head is that these disorders only exist in the first world (pace the blogger who says it only exists in four countries and then lists Western Europe as a country). Whether it’s pollution or pesticides or BPA or fructose that makes everybody sick, one way or another we are all swimming in it.
Pennywell Folsom fell in the first volley fired in Battle of Brushy Creek, fought in July, 1836. After the fighting was over, Captain Hamilton Sharpe carried Folsom from the battlefield on horseback, but the mortally wounded soldier could not long survive. Folsom was carried back to the fort at the Rachel Morrison place (now the property of the Rountree family) near the Little River, where he was buried in a lone grave. Sharpe’s Company fired a volley of gunfire over the grave in salute to their fallen comrade. As that final tribute sounded through the forest, Captain Levi J. Knight and his company of men arrived on the scene. (Levi J. Knight was the original settler on the site of present day Ray City, GA.) Knight’s company had marched 30 miles from the Alapaha River where they had skirmished with Indians at the homeplace of William Parker. (see Short-Arm Bill Parker and the Last Indian Fight In Berrien County.)
When short of a blog idea, I highly recommend going along to one of Lewis Schaffer’s free shows and then letting him buy you a Chinese meal and/or an expensive ice cream afterwards. It costs you nothing and New York Jewish comedians’ neuroses are always a bottomless pit to excavate. It also makes you feel better. You think: At least my life is not THAT shit…

When I earn money I pay PAYE, when I buy fuel I'm taxed, when I use my cell phone or browse the Internet I pay communications tax, for daring to use electricity I'm hit with street light levy, drinking packaged water earns me a tax wrath, driving to the office from Kasoa, Afienya, Tema etc is punished for my inability to rent a house in airport with tolls, If I own a cottage I pay property rates , ignore the fact that the roads around my property will never see development in decades and I have to find more money for zoom lion to collect the rubbish I generate, and above all I pay 15% VAT directly or indirectly for all other goods and services. So under all my heavy burden of taxes, I throw my hands up into the air and decide to forget all my problems with two tots of local gin but that doesn't go well with the tax professor president so he gives me a stern rebuke with an alcohol tax. What next Mr President? Please spare the air that we breath. But do I get anything in return for all these taxes? Is that what they call the social contract? I can only concur with Kwaw kese, ABODAM!

When it comes to your wardrobe I suggest you really re-evaluate what you have and get rid of any items you are never going to wear again. These are usually items which are worn and need repairing or you've had them since 1994 and seriously you are never going to wear them again.

I don’t do a lot of scolding. I don’t call her a naughty girl (unless I’m kidding) and I don’t usually express a lot of anger. If I AM angry, I figure I’m expressing it by the spanking. I know some couples do find that scolding helps, but we choose not to. We talk ahead of time to make sure she’s clear as to why she’s getting spanked because I find she’s often unclear. Sometimes I tell her what I expect of her and why she’s getting this spanking and how I want for things to be different.

I liked this dress. It fit well and was different in color and shape from anything I would ever buy! What I didnt like was the back, it was racerback on the top and then backless towards my lower back. I might be a slight bit modest when it comes to that, and I didnt want to buy a dress I could only ever wear with a jacket. But I loved the dress! I considered keeping this one for a long time!
The new skill system is a bit confusing at first, but it works. The heroes seem evenly balanced and able to handle each other.

Thank you for that…

So how can President Obama get away with saying that Warren Buffett pays lower tax rates than his secretary? Many wealthy Americans who have done well like Buffett receive dividends and capital gains — a form of investment income that is subject to multiple levels of tax. First, the investment income results from investment. This capital didn’t appear out of thin air. It was earned and taxed previously, often many times over at rates up to 35 percent.

For my final image today I drew this egret preening his wing on a log. My scanner did not pick up the subtle colors as much as I would like (the soft blue sky goes half-way up the picture and you can actually see where I made blue-gray strokes between feathers). However, you get the idea of how I use the subtle blues and grays to accent the shadows of white on his underside and where his feathers meet.

In 1888, Pope Leo XIII received a vision which confirms the Synagogue-Masonic plot to use the Holy See itself, through the weakness of its occupants, in “preaching” – though, again for this is an important distinction, not in the official capacity as the Supreme Doctor and Pastor of the Universal Church exercising Papal Infallibility – the diabolical 1789 principles. This vision made the Pontiff compose a long Prayer to St. Michael – the short form of which was ordered to be recited at the end of the Traditional Low Mass in Latin but was suppressed after Vatican II. In the long version, Pope Leo calls the devil “this wicked dragon,” and accuses Satan and his “apostate host” thus:

Inspiration and influence, we find, is a shadowy world where there is a fertile ground for speculation but little room for definite answers. Inspiration is not a clean one to one correspondence – it is not the clichéd Eureka moment, it is not (at least for us mortals) the hot ember burning Isaiah’s lips. Instead, it is shop talk, it is friendships and debates, it is having another artist make you want to be better in your work. In this protean “creation on the fly” world, it is hard to directly say who influenced who or how an outcome came about.

I can't summarize Patton's act completely (though I totally fell in love with him because of it), I do want to touch on one bit at the very end. He sets it up by explaining that he flew his and his fiancee's parents to Las Vegas and they all went to a Cirque Du Soleil show. He'd never seen it before and was stunned to see all these red state folks loving, "The gayest thing I've ever seen! There's a hoop on fire and a tiger dressed as a butler and three clowns jerking off on a ghost. It's French and wet and on fire. Why do these conservatives love it?! Apparently this is the way for the gay people to make progress. Can we put on tuxes, kiss, and make a life-long pledge to each other? No faggot! How about I blow my boyfriend on this trapeze? Great! We'll bring the kids."
After the descent into violent conflict, there will be vast swathes of the country that have no unusual military presence at all, and that will be free zones for British paramilitaries to move, train, and organize as they deem appropriate. Only ‘normal’ police attention will be brought to bear on them. This will allow these areas to play a role similar to the one which the Republic of Ireland played for the PIRA during the Troubles, allowing them to operate with a minimum of scrutiny. Of course, the RUC could not operate at all in the Republic, and it was difficult if not impossible for the British government to have terrorist suspects extradited to the UK, two advantages that British paramilitaries will not have during the conflict in their own hinterlands. Nonetheless, they will still enjoy huge freedom of movement and action in this area, and the police will find it very difficult indeed to disrupt it. The more vicious the conflict becomes, the less willingness there will be a) on the part of local people to report suspicious events, and b) on the part of the British police to act against British paramilitaries anyway.

My own road to atheism was not so fraught. I’d never believed, never been brainwashed by my family or school. In fact at primary school I couldn’t believe that any of us believed. We used to take the piss something rotten out of the school’s vicar. The Grumbleweeds were a crap childishly-humorous pop band at the time and one of the band was introduced with the call ‘Watchya, Baldy!’ Our vicar was almost bald so he got the same treatment from our class when he came to spout his Christian bollocks.
The kids kept going towards the street. They bickered. The toddler spent the chilly afternoon peeing in her pants then walking around outside with no pants on. The baby ate grass and whimpered. My four year old DID pull weeds right along with me (but she wanted chocolate in exchange) so there were probably a few teaching moments. But truthfully, I spent too much time wondering what the hell the neighbors thought about me and my four feral kids and hoping nobody called 911 about a loose two year old.

The first is that unlike Pride and Prejudice and Emma, Sense and Sensibility delivers you into the hand (and mind) of a central character it is very difficult to feel for. I get the impression that Austen began the book thinking that Elinor was the natural heroine, the sister most people would sympathise with, but the longer the novel goes on, the less clear this impression becomes. It is also very hard at times to distinguish between what Elinor thinks and what the impersonal narrator is saying. Occasionally, some very nasty things are said, and people are most cruelly depicted, but it is difficult to tell whose opinion this is...

What's wild about this underground venue/arts space is that it looks and feels pretty much like the way it was at an illegal loft party/squat back in the 80s (but instead of Bushwick, it was Manhattan's East Village/Lower East Side)...and the mix of punks (yes, there were impressive mohawks), skins, and everyone else in black was pretty much the same then as now. The black box performance space (which could fit 150--maybe--was up front with a small stage, great sound system, dance floor, and two raised platforms lining part of the room for sitting or standing on. The remainder of the venue consisted of a long, wide hall (just past the kitchen, where they sold beer); a room for lounging in the back; and a door leading to some outdoor metal stairs down to the "backyard."Here is video of a recent show from The Lake that includes Rudies Don't Care performing:

It presents the stories of six Japanese mail-order brides whose new lives are marked by backbreaking migrant work, cultural struggles, children who reject their heritage, and the prospect of wartime internment.

Ok so about 4 weeks ago, Mother's Day weekend to be exact, Hailey, the kids and I all decided to get our garden planted and on schedule. Hailey actually had us start this tradition two years ago and this will be summer garden number three. I'm not sure when it started, to be honest, probably growing up in Ohio with my own parents gardening, but I have this strange fascination with herbs, veggies and I even want to like eating raw tomatoes this year. Anyway in addition to this vegetable garden thing, Hailey has been consistently working out with her pilates group for a few months straight, but I have been slacking - until this past monday that is. I just started crossfit over at cross fit timpanogos. To say the least it is killing my trash but I am loving it.

My opinion of the story hasn’t changed since I first read the book about 2 years ago – the heroine Melody was needlessly and relentlessly stupid about Jones, the SEAL who knocked her up after rescuing her from terrorists. But I liked the narrator Maia Guest’s treatment of the characters, and – maybe it’s the moon – found myself weepy near the end when even he gives up on himself and her, and walks away. This is another of those frothy bits of fluff – short and sweet and satisfying (except for when you want to strangle the stubbornly stupid heroine). Yeah, he comes back and they finally get married and have a HEA – what did you think?? It’s not romance unless they get the HEA!

12 hours after I ruptured, the midwife came in with a look on her face that did not inspire confidence. She told me that with the fear of infection and the fact that I had only dilated 3 centimeters, she thought it best to try a bit of enhancement. She suggested what my dad calls "a sniff of Pit." A small dose of Pitocin, with some Benadryl and a pain medication so I could rest before the birthing stage. Her biggest concerns were 1) getting the baby out before we hit the 24 hour mark, and 2) making sure that I had the energy to push once I was ready.

While he was thrashing around in the dark they quietly circled. They had picked up his scent, and the sweet aroma of flesh drew them to him like a beacon. It had been days since they had eaten, and their shrunken stomachs rumbled in pain. With cold precision they closed in on him, flanking him on all sides. Their need to eat was a primal lust, it took precedent over, sleep, warmth, procreation. It had become their singular driving force these past few days. Prey had become scarce, and they were getting desperate.

Miss Shoemaker was an old-fashioned teacher who considered herself responsible not just for our academic progress, but for our health and morals as well. Daily inspections of hands and fingernails for cleanliness occurred. Her shrewd eyes took in a missing button or a tear in our uniforms. She’d dash off little notes, "Give this to your mother. Your tunic needs mending." Occasionally, she’d complete the repair herself, whipping out navy cotton thread or white, fishing buttons from a small box she kept in her desk.

Long before Jack left his South Carolina hometown to attend college and eventually move to New York afterward to become an investment banker he remembered his grandmother talking about something called a conniption fit. According to her, it was the worst of behaviors usually reserved for hopelessly spoiled children who desperately needed a good, old-fashioned spanking with a belt until they could not sit down anymore. As a child Jack had never actually seen the nearly mystical seizure put on by anyone but the woman he believed to be his new wife was surely showing him one now.
Around 5:30 pm, one of the Occupiers climbed on the roof and began throwing heavy metal pipes, bricks and other objects down on the police and crowd gathered outside the building. While several bricks were aimed at the officers on Turk Street, only one of the demonstrators was hurt when he was hit in the face by a brick. The man on the roof, Jesse Nesbit, 34, was arrested after he left the building and charged with felony assault.

After rinsing off the river water we assembled again and headed off to check out the Texas wine scene. We managed to herd most of our group to the Mandola Estate Winery, located in a lovely setting in rolling hills just south of Austin, with rows of grape vines improbably planted among the cattle ranches and barbeque pits of this area. A beautiful limestone building houses a restaurant and winery, with wine tastings available. We tasted a Pinot Grigio, Viognier, Rose, and Zinfandel, among others. Most were not memorable, though drinkable, with the Viognier standing out as the crowd favorite. The ambiance was lovely and the family enjoyed cheese and crackers, sipping wine and enjoying each others’ company.

Monday morning saw the MoS heading back to work and me back to my apartment, where the cats gave me a talking to about leaving them on their own for 3 1/2 days. I think Lila was telling me about all the fun she had, and Pips gave me hell for not being around to scratch her neck and make my lap available when she required it!

In March 1954 Maxwell Fyfe told Cabinet, “that large numbers of coloured people are living on National Assistance” and that “coloured landlords by their conduct are making life difficult for white people living in the same building or area…the result is that white people leave and the accommodation is then converted to furnished lettings for coloured people, with serious overcrowding and exploitation”.

Speaking of which, I need to go feed him again now. I'm going to make my sponge with him on Sunday and if all goes well, I will be able to share my first loaf of sour dough bread from Finn Jr. on Monday with some friends we're having over for dinner. I'm actually going to be sad when it becomes time for me to put Finn Jr. into the fridge and I don't have to feed him everyday but like all children, he will need to move out of the nest and learn to fend mainly on his own.

The Ranger asked where she was and my dad pointed to the power boat bobbing at the dock. The Ranger, who happened to be a Medic, jumped in his Jeep, radioed for an ambulance, drove down the ramp, grabbed his bag and ran to where she was in the boat. He, on the bobbing boat, started an I.V. of something, and then the ambulance was there and they were loading her onto the gurney.
I also moved the butterfly bush. It is also too big and needs too much sun for where it fits. So he's gone out back to the parking area where he can have all the room and sun he can stand.

Ann Romney has said that her chosen career was being a mother. I couldn't agree more. For women like us, raising our children is the most important job we can have. For me, being the subject of my daughter's essay on role models is better than any bonus. Seeing my children using the life lessons I have tried to instill in them to raise themselves up and strive for more is better than any promotion. And contrary to Ms. Rosen's bungled talking points, staying home isn't a 'luxury' for most women, it just makes sense. I take nothing from working moms - I was raised by two and used to be one myself. I have enormous respect for women who pursue a career and manage to juggle it all. But because our priorities are different from Ms. Rosen's doesn't make them any less legitimate

Chapter 6 of Shawn Ritenour’s Foundations of Economics examines what happens when the supply or demand of a good or service in the marketplace changes. Ritenour makes the point that confusion sometimes results from a change in market prices. When the price of, say, coffee rises, this is not necessarily indicative of a rise in demand. Demand may be exactly the same as before, but a reduction of supply may have led to the price increase. The reverse is also true; a price may change even though supply is constant if demand changes.

In between this time I meet hubby. We dated four short months before he proposed. It honestly was love at first sight. We also discovered that having children might be difficult because after suffering for years I was finally diagnosed with endometriosis, which meant my fallopian tubes had a build of up scar tissue. I had surgery at the age of 25 and was told to start trying to have children immediately. We did just that thinking it would take years but we were blessed and nine months later our first son was

Tuesday, we had an important visitor at work so I felt like I needed to wash it. I did the BS wash, ACV rinse, put a bit of EVOO on my ends (although I think I used too much) and then blow-dried it on the coolest setting. It took forever but it wasn't so bad. Then I flat ironed it on 300. It didn't get all of the waves out but it was passable. I was pretty happy with it. It looks a lot fuller and thicker than normal. My ends were sort of clumped which I think was due to the EVOO.

Something that has come up, and keeps coming up, is Thrall’s “real name” — that being Go’el. This was first revealed to us by Greatmother Geyah in Nagrand back in ‘The Burning Crusade.’ Now, it has become a topic of intense discussion when concerning our Warchief. Aggra, a female orc assigned to further Thrall’s training as a shaman seems to be spearheading an effort to have him fully adopt his ‘real name’ and ‘become who he truly is.’

Last week was rough with four late nights at work, I wasn’t able to fit the gym into my schedule. I am feeling good doing this diet. Turned down red velvet cake, whoopie pie cake, and a cupcake. That’s right. Go me. The diet is restricting and makes it hard to eat on the run, but I am sticking with it. Discipline baby. I will get back into a size 10. I will get back into a size 10.

Along with finding some really great books, keeping track of what I read has benefits, especially when people ask me for book recommendations for those age groups. The more MG and YA fiction I read, the more I realize how much I enjoy it. The stories are faster paced and usually always emotionally satisfying. There are so many good children's writers, I never feel that I'm missing something by not reading more books for adults.

16. Because few others in your society have the knowledge you do, reactions of the masses to forthcoming profound truths, reforms and the introduction of other members of the universal family will be confusion, denial and varying degrees of fear. Your calming influence will be greatly needed, and as we often have stated, you are well prepared not only to deal with whatever you encounter, but to help all who are willing to accept it. It is not necessary to know the missions you chose in soul contracts — when occasions are presented, you will see that your spiritual strength, wisdom and experiences in multiple lifetimes will be at your fingertips.
My own personal experience of screening the The Forgotten Refugees and The Silent Exodus in venues across London, always ends with most people in the audience (both Jewish and non) telling me that they had no idea about the plight of these Jewish refugees. Even children of the Sephardim (Jews who settled around the Mediterranean basin) and Mizrahim (‘eastern’ Jews ) don't know how their parents suffered in Arab lands, as they have been reluctant to recount their stories. They arrived in Israel and the West stripped of their assets on leaving their birth countries, but at least the majority had escaped with their lives. Hearing the horror stories of the Holocaust in Europe, they felt unable to retell their stories. In those early years they suffered silently and experienced the double humiliation of being treated as 2nd class citizens by the ruling Ashkenazi elite.

There were hockey rinks, soccer fields, a gym with a working scoreboard. What house is complete without one? They have their own performing studios, and an “every day is a holiday” theme so they can keep the Christmas tree up all year-long. I’ve seen a chair museum in place of a dining room table, psychedelic, modern, artistic mansions, no MANSIONS. These homes are described by their parents as “having a place where we all feel comfortable.” Give me a break.
Maybe if I related to her as a woman. But, she is a mother, if by a mother you mean a female parent. Sometimes DD calls K "Mommy," which doesn't bother me.

She said she is following the WWLD principle (L being me, the family's sacrificial lamb).
The museum is divided into 3 levels: the first depicts Van Gogh's influences and their work, the second shows his contemporaries and how they influenced his work, and the third reveals other famous artists(and contemporaries) that were creating at the same time as Van Gogh. You need a couple of hours at least, but worth the time in order to examine his techniques and influences.

I was thinking today about all the childhood tv shows I used to watch (I know ANOTHER reminiscing topic!) and I can’t help but think how crappy cartoons are nowdays compared to the one’s that used to be on.. I feel sorry for kids these days growing up without CatDog, Hey Arnold!, Ahhh Real Monsters, Rugrats (before they got old) Rainbow Bright, Evil Sesame Street (where the cookie monster ate cookies and Oscar the grouch was still a grumpy fuck) Those shows didn’t hurt me, or anyone else for that matter so why replace it with this crap.. Personally I think that Ben 10 is much more fucked up than anything else from back then..

If they succeed, surely Upstairs’ insurers have also thereby acknowledged their responsibility for our things, a few feet below. Whether they (the things) were insured or not is totally irrelevant. And if Upstairs’ insurance doesn’t extend to our things, then…

I read over and over--and I really do believe it's true--that one of the most important parts of a witch's practice is learning to make meditation and visualization a regular part of their day. I KNOW this...I BELIEVE this...so why, Oh WHY,. is this so hard for me to do? I mean, ya, I get busy. I have a 9 year old son and husband. I have a job. I have a home to take care of. I am sure if I really wanted to I could sit down and make a big long list of all the reasons why I have not made these things a priority in my life--I am sure we all could. The problem with this is--I KNOW I could find the time somewhere. I know there are times when my butt is sitting at this computer that I could be doing other things. So really all my excuses could fall by the wayside. In other words--they don't hold water. They just don't.

What makes the process of ternary thinking fascinating is that its effects are not necessarily limited to the person who practices it. Fairly often, when a discussion is mired in reactive binary thinking, it only takes one person resolutely bringing up a third option over and over again, to pop at least some of the participants out of the binary trap, and get them thinking about other options. They may end up staying with the option they originally supported, but they’re more likely to do it in a reasoned way rather than an automatic, unthinking way. They’re also more likely to be able to recognize that the other sides of the debate also have their points, and to be able to find grounds for mutual cooperation, because they aren’t stuck in a mental automatism that loads a torrent of positive emotions onto their side of the balance and an equal and opposite torrent of negative emotions onto the other side.

Today was Jazz Fest down at the Fair Grounds. We were pretty impressed that it was the whole Fairgrounds, Race track area included. there was 5 different major stages and I think we caught acts on all 5 through out the day. We split up and the “Littles” as I call them (Taylor, Sarah and Dani) took off to wander the grounds and merchandise stalls and catch as many acts as they could. I started off my day with Marissa and Brittaney until we lost each other. The Fairgrounds were packed and there was some amazing music. My fav was Trombone Shorty and they were stoked to catch Iron and Wine. We also saw Al Green, caught a Secondline parade and saw the very entertaining Janella Monet. I got to see a whole bunch of Mardi Gras Indians sing “li’l Liza Jane” and that totally made my day!
Christmas, for those who believe and even those who are skeptics, is the power of God to change human lives. It conveys the hope that there really can be peace on earth, and that mankind can learn to love and prosper under the guiding and loving watch of a gracious and awesome supreme being. Christmas is, by its very nature, eternal, remaining in the soul and influencing the entire world. A holiday ends when the day is done. Christmas is the centerpiece toward which an entire year propels itself. This celebration crowns all others in its nobility and grace, its beauty and charisma. Even Santa Claus would be absent were it not for the inspiration of a real saint named Nicholas who gave out gifts and was attributed as having performed miracles.
HOW THE FLYING FUCK
Lucky had plans for Rob and I to write his cookbook of jealously guarded recipes for him. That all came to a bit of a sticky end when, one evening hanging about in our press office lair, he demanded money (without menaces) from us for what he considered the privilege of writing his cookbook for him. Lucky, it’s the other way around, you’d need to pay us to write it for you, Rob told him. Ras-clat, you no understand, countered Lucky. These are my recipes. You two g’wan pay I. Lucky’s reputation preceded him; he wasn’t really a man to argue with and whether he still packed a gun was open to debate but his hard-man reputation was very real.

The beginning of the High Street is marked by what is today called Littlehampton United Church. Built in 1861, the church today apparently serves two congregations, hence the slightly odd name. It is used by both Methodist and United Reformed Church congregations. I suppose that, in an age where people are increasingly seeing through the deceit and delusion of religion and, consequently, church attendance is going into mortal decline with large numbers of churches being decommissioned, it make sense to combine resources in this way.
I think there is little reason to go out in public unarmed anymore. If you are going to get a CCW, then learn the tools needed to do so safely and effectively. The second video is an excellent one to understand how to do CCW and not be uncomfortable. Remember, if you are uncomfortable you won’t carry, and if you won’t carry then you are not protecting yourself or your family. I respect the police and worked with them for years. I did not know a single rogue cop. Every officer I knew would give their life to protect the citizens, but the sad fact is that most police show up after the crime to gather evidence and write reports. They cannot be there for you most of the time, and you are responsible for your life and the life of your family. Learn how to do it safely, skillfully, and effectively!

He traveled quite a bit so I had a lot of down time but instead of sitting around doing nothing, I used that as an opportunity to learn other aspects of the company and take on new responsibilities. Within six months, I not only was supporting the V.P. but was also in charge of their new building & employee security system, became their facility coordinator, assisted the IT staff with the network, and developed and taught my own computer classes to teach engineers how to use Microsoft Office programs. Even though the company had increased their support staff, many of the entry-level engineers still had to do much of their own paperwork.

The Kuru King and his brothers are Yuddhiṣṭhira, Bhīma, Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva. Their wife is Draupadī. Their mother is Kuntī.

After the war was over, the members of both side of the previously divided family united to mourn their dead together. That seems a significant moral lesson.
When I woke, I could hear one of my guides telling me quite loudly to go for a walk. I’ve learned through experience to trust my guides and go with whatever they’re telling me because they’re always right. I splashed some cold water on my face, changed into some clothes and grabbed a quick cup of coffee to take along on my walk. I was staying at Marga Country Park, home of a magnificent estate built around 1870 and just below the estate were the ruins of an old Abby. The estate or castle, whichever you prefer to call it, was from the neo-gothic time period surrounded by lush gardens and the beautiful rolling hills of Wales. In the distance, nestled high on a hillside, you could see the ruins of a monastery. Now being a bit of nature person, I thought to myself what a wonderful place to go for a stroll and maybe, just maybe, a brilliant idea would come to me for my speech.

Now about housing: This is big potential for creating jobs. If there is no money you cannot pay rent or mortgage loans. Really the ideal thing would be to say to start with is: whatever house you are in for now is yours. There are very few reasons why someone needs more than one house and they can always be accounted for in allowances. Yes there will be also shitholes out there, but that is where the jobs come in. So many people don’t have homes or the accommodation they do have is uninhabitable or in run down areas. For those with inadequate housing, we just start a list much like a housing list for council accommodation in Britain, except it registers all available housing, monitors their condition; making repairs when needed. As soon as new or renovated buildings are ready they get matched against the needs of those at the top of the list, with those in the most need due to age, ill health or the condition of their current residence, being given priority for the available housing first.

One aim of BookTown Australia is to give World Book Day a context to be celebrated in Australia and link it to the international community of booktowns. Using World Book Day as the commencement of the One Town – One Book community reading programs is seen as viable means of doing so, especially as the reading program can then culminate in August to coincide with Children’s Book Week. On World Book Day (April 23) in Australia in years to come, any community – village, town suburb or city – can be a “booktown” on that day, simply by declaring its participation in the reading program with the announcement of their chosen book.

Red Mist, Patricia Cornwell - The book released a while ago, but I started to read it and just couldn't get into the story. So I left it alone for a while. Finally had nothing left to read and decided to finish it, and I'm glad I did. Kay Scarpetta travels to the Georgia Prison for Women, where she meets with an inmate who has apparent information about the death of Scarpetta's former assistant, now deceased. It turns out his death is related to other deaths, his lover is involved in some serial killings, her daughter is a killer, too... After the first few chapters, it was back to Cornwell's usual good story.
I have never had students create comic strips in class even though I have heard of it often. I think it is because I had in my head that the comic had to be funny, and I thought it would be difficult for studens to create funny situations with whatever we were studying at the time. I am warming up to the idea, however, realizing that the word “comic” can be used loosely to basically mean a dialogue in comic strip format. I still have not had students create the comics yet, but I did create some comic strips at Make Beliefs Comix for students to fill in the last speech bubble. All of the scenarios are inviting someone to do something, but they decline the invitation and tell what they are going to do instead based on the excuse I wrote in the comic strip. I’ll see how it goes tomorrow; maybe I’ll have the students create their own comic strips as the next step.

I am not an advocate of banning cigarettes and alcohol. I just don’t understand why we single them out for being legal, when marijuana, cocaine, and heroin could have more legitimate medical uses. Marijuana apparently is good for both easing the pain of some cancers and AIDS, and for treating glaucoma. I can speak from firsthand experience that cocaine is an excellent coagulant and can be used in times when there is a hemorrhage. And Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain once said that heroin was the only thing he could find that would ease the pain of his congenital stomach problems. I believe him.

Methods: We located and characterized papers published in peer-reviewed journals which reported autistic cognitive strengths. In order to be included, studies had to compare the performance of autistics to the performance of nonautistics on a task, and autistics had to be reported to perform better than their controls on the task. Studies specific to autistic savants and hyperlexics were excluded, as were probable but unclear reports of autistic strengths, and accidental findings arising from matching strategies. Autistic cognitive strengths originally reported and/or interpreted as deficits were included.

Told alternately from the point of view of the guilt-ridden, determined father and his meandering, ruminative son, The Good Father is a powerfully emotional page-turner that keeps one guessing until the very end. This is an absorbing and honest novel about the responsibilities—and limitations—of being a parent and our capacity to provide our children with unconditional love in the face of an unthinkable situation.
All contributions will be double-blind peer reviewed. To facilitate the review process, authors should make an effort to ensure that their identity is not revealed by information contained in their submission. For example, references to a contributor’s work in an abstract should not name the contributor. Instead, for example, replace the author’s proper name by the term “Author”, including any bibliographic data and footnotes. Additionally, paper titles should be removed.

I started writing the lyrics for The Great Depression maybe a decade ago. The title was inspired by something Brad Pitt's character said in Fight Club: "We're the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our Great War's a spiritual war... our Great Depression is our lives." At the time that really struck a chord with me, because I was struggling with my own personal depression, and was linking how I felt to wider conditions in society. But when I listened to even some of my favourite artists of the time, though many would go on about feeling sad, isolated and lonely, few would ever ask 'why?' So I decided to do that in a series of lyrics.
It was a beautiful reminder that all of creation holds surprises if we can keep our hearts and minds open to its possibilities. We can be so quick to box and label our days, our seasons, our experiences, and ourselves; how lovely to be stopped in my tracks and have my expectations upended so delightfully.

Long awaited, this stunning Sarah Burton creation works for Kate in four key ways: a. The corseted bodice emphasises Kate’s incredible waist, b. the padded hips add feminine curves and add further emphasis to her waist c. The delicate lace complements the sweetheart neckline and covers her up appropriately for the regal ceremony and d. the traditional – yet modest – train and veil make the dress oh-so occasion appropriate. Look-alike tops and dresses are everywhere, but if you want to channel Kate without looking like a demented wannabe bride, choose a black or coloured version such as this Asos dress or H & M’s structured top (on sale!)

What took me by surprise, though, was the absolute abundance, no, super-proliferation, of handcrafted turquoise and silver, in all shapes, sizes and forms, whichever way we turned.

Dr. Stephanie’s passion is marriage, children, and families. Raised on a Nebraska farm as the oldest of five children, she attributes her strong work ethic to life growing up on the farm. She is no stranger to adversity and attributes her accomplishments to the hard work and perseverance she learned from her own family upbringing. Dr. Stephanie’s parents started Weiland Doors (http://www.weilanddoors.com/), and they role modeled an entrepreunerial spirit that she carries with her to this day.
Some tips to get started:
The new Samsung NX10 is a camera with interchangeable lenses, no mirror reflex, but with an electronic viewfinder. Therefore it incorporates the outline of the Panasonic G1 and GH1, preserving the appearance of a reflex, albeit with a bodiless option and with the electronic viewfinder in the center, above the screen and with a shape similar to the upper cap with a pentaprism SLR.
It was a good thing that I've been hanging around, as it gave me space to remember that there was a casserole in the oven and I've taken it out. No smells emanate from the Aga so there is nothing to remind you when a dish is ready - or overcooked - or burned. Not that it ever burns in the bottom oven, it just sits there getting darker. I was making spag bol for supper - not that I'd dream of calling it spag bol myself of course, it's just to save time typing. I'm not big on abbreviations (and have never shortened university to its first three letters in my life. You knee. Hmph.) and have been known to get quite cross. Apart from sensible ones, obv, darls, y'know what I mean.

This movie is stupid! Everything about it is horrible. It makes the other ones I’ve reviewed look like masterpieces in comparison. Hellraiser: Bloodline? More like Hellraiser: Bled Out. There was no coherency here – it was a big mess of epic proportions. I mean, even if I’m supposed to take it that this was intended to be the very last Hellraiser film ever, and no one had plans to do any more, it’s still a giant pile of suck. The meager 85-minute runtime is padded out to ridiculous levels with nonsense like Pinhead’s speeches, the garbage with Angelique doing stuff despite her storyline going nowhere in the end and of course the scenes of the military guys hiding from the cenobites – seriously, it’s worthless. Padding so fluffed up it might as well be thicker than the actual substance of the movie.
Today is the first real day of spring. I think it's absolutely wonderful, I'd forgotten how much I missed experiencing the changing seasons. I've been living with Dan for three-ish weeks already. It's funny how well we're getting along, and I wonder what will happen when his parents come visit and I start traveling. Somewhere deep in the recesses of my imagination, I'm harbouring thoughts of genuinely wanting to develop this relationship further. I don't know why, it just feels like it'll be worth it. The fact that he's poly-amourous and shared the same sentiment as I do about multiple partners probably has something to do with making me more open to the idea. To other people it might seem like an unwillingness to commit, perhaps it is that, but from my vantage point, I see it as being able to let go of a petty, negative feeling. But I won't go on about it.
(2) Nirvana, to my way of understanding, means permanent enlightenment and that to me means sahaja nirvikalpa samadhi. What we will experience may be no higher than Brahmajnana or God-Realization. The lesser event happens when the kundalini reaches the seventh chakra and results in a temporary heart opening. The greater event happens when the kundalini doubles back on the hridayam or spiritual heart and results in a permanent heart opening. Much about the stages of enlightenment is fully explained here: http://www.angelfire.com/space2/light11/fdl/e1.html The whole dictionary to be found at that URL is on enlightenment.

The men tuck in. I know this because in hot weather, they immodestly remove their blazers. The gleaming of their shoes could illuminate a sketchy intersection. Suits, suits are everywhere – and, unlike in San Francisco, it isn’t drag. Pink button-downs abound, but their wearers seem straight as an arrow. The men sport crew cuts. No curls or artistically-arranged facial hair here (I’m still talking about men, now).
It's not enough to allow our readers to live vicariously through our characters. We need to make our stories so engaging that when readers finish them, they get up and go have the same experiences themselves: travel to a distant location and explore the location on foot, or plant a garden or make your own clothes like our pioneer ancestors. But most importantly, ask questions, especially "why" and "how."
After the escape in Brazil, Bruce decides he needs to come north to the United States and he goes to his old stomping grounds. He sees Betty but doesn’t approach her. Instead, he goes to his old pizza shop hangout and gets the owner, Stanley, to let him crash upstairs for a bit. Stanley is played by Paul Soles, who voiced Bruce Banner in the 1960s cartoon. Before long, Bruce walks out of the kitchen when Betty and her new boyfriend, Leonard Samson (Ty Burrell), are visiting. Betty sees him and chases Bruce down, taking him to the house she shares with Samson.

Like many English majors, I was brainwashed in college against reading any genre fiction. Growing up as a reader has involved letting go of that arbitrary prejudice and learning to enjoy a variety of genres: in the last year alone I've read a fantasy, a mystery, several YAs, and a thriller. Excellent writing exists across genres, and the tagline “literary” is no guarantee of artistic merit, much less reading enjoyment. This week, I’m delighted to introduce our readers to Gabi Stevens, author of the Time of Transition series, classified as “paranormal romance” and described by one Amazon reviewer as “a mix between contemporary romance and Harry Potter.” (Ms. Stevens has also kindly offered a book giveaway: see end for details.)

Think of one small object in your house to which you are emotionally attached, something that you love for some intangible reason, something that would seem not valuable and ordinary to most any one else. Can you identify and describe why that object is important to you? Why did you save it in the first place, and what keeps you from tossing it with the next yard sale or round of spring cleaning? If you are like me, you have many objects that fall into that category.

We are so desperate to know. In knowing, there is an illusion of control. In the New Testament era, in knowing someone’s name there was a belief that one held power over another. You see it when the demons Jesus encountered claimed, “I know who you are, Jesus the holy one of God!” We feel safer and even more powerful when we think we have control, or simply know what to expect. Men become workaholics because managing the office world makes them feel powerful and important as they manage the workload and predict trends and trials. Moms will allow their lives to become consumed by their children because they find value and worth in shaping the lives of their kids and in who their kids become. We fall into our ruts and rat-races because its easier to manage than an unknown…and since God’s ways are not like ours, the Christian life – following Jesus – is full of unknowns.

I am surprisingly upset about this. Horses come and go all the time at our facility, it's just part of the rehab and conditioning process. It doesn't affect me in the slightest, and even if I particularly liked the horse (I work with them 5, 6, or 7 days a week depending, so they tend to get more attention on the whole than Bay Girl does from me), the most I ever think when they leave is "aw, bye horsey." But not Bay Girl. When we found out the owner is taking her to a different place, my heart sank. That is less than a month away. I've been a bit back and forth about the process... should I stop playing with her and wean myself off of her so I don't get so upset when she leaves? (And let her wean herself off of me.... she surely will not be getting half as much attention anywhere else that she goes). Or should I try to squeeze in as much time with her as possible?

My novella, PIERCING THROUGH THE DARKNESS, is based on a college student named Kandi with repressed memories of a tragic accident she’s had. Her family took her to see a psychiatrist who tried hypnosis to recover the memories, but it didn’t take. So, they had to pretend like nothing ever happened to her. She has this huge secret what could potentially kill her, and she doesn’t even know it. Her best friend, Jimmy, has to protect her, and when the man who’s out for revenge threatens her life, he feels like there isn’t anything he can do to protect her. The novella is told in three different people’s point of view, and as we follow them through the story, it’s all about these characters finding their way through the darkness that is figuratively surrounding them.

I don’t see it that way, I see the State of Israel as a state, a Jewish one (whatever that means), as I see Denmark as a Christian state, both being secular, but both giving a special place for Judaism and Christianity respectively as the main religions, but not the only religions. Neither do I see the State of Israel as the beginning of redemption, though I certainly pray for its wellbeing, as I did and still do with Denmark, and for the whole humankind. For example, when I pray the ‘Birkat HaMazon,’ the prayer said after eating bread, the Koren Siddur, which I use, has the addition of blessing Israel being the beginning of the Redemption, which I have used as title for this post, though this is in no way standard for the most Siddurim. This addition I don’t pray, though I do pray for the wellbeing of the soldiers in IDF, who are ‘standing guard’ over Israel.

Unfortunately, when the best thing you can say about an episode is that Amy looks hot as a pirate … yeah, duh. I need more than that and BLACK SPOT doesn’t deliver.
La Bonne Soupe is true to its name; it focuses on soup. (Owners Jean-Paul and Monique Picot took the bistro's name from a French comedy playwright Félicien Marceau from the 1950s.) Though there are plenty of other things on the menu, the centerpiece are four daily soups, including French Onion, which are served with bread, salad, dessert and (of course) a glass of wine, all for $16.75.
As an adult, marriage, work and raising two sons took priority. And while I fell madly in love with reading romance, there wasn’t much time to write it. It’s amazing how much corporate life, soccer games, high school musicals, dinner and laundry can suck out of the average day. But I would occasionally dabble in writing, then put it aside when I got busy. Unfortunately, I was always busy.
God had other plans. Instead, I don’t even remember waking up to my early phone alarm, but only to wake an hour and a half later on my own. I feel and look to where my phone is usually kept, but it’s nowhere. I feel and search around my bed, underneath the pillows, underneath my blankets, but it’s nowhere. I quickly jump out of bed, turn on my light to search high and low for my phone, but it’s nowhere. Heart beating faster and faster, worry comes over me, did I throw it somewhere? Did I talk to someone half asleep on the phone? Was I angry because the alarm went off?
um.. well, no..after the 20 questions about "now, why are you having this done" and not fully understanding the concept of the band they call the radiologist.. (really?) . Then the tech goes on to tell me I dont look like I need a tummy tuck..

My Knit Picks order, which is funny. I took this photograph because my coworker and I always joke how we place and order and a day or two later get the new catalog, with something new and exciting. This shipment actually arrived WITH the new catalog.

Just as Jesus refused to be boxed in by the cultural expectation that he was only a “carpenter” let us also breakaway from the concept that we are only “laity”. We need to recognize that we, each of us, constitute the body of Christ and each of us is called to specifically manifest the person of Christ in whatever role or profession we may be involved in this world. The distinguishing mark of a disciple is that we love as Jesus loves (Jn 13:34-35). Only the Holy Spirit working in us can accomplish this – for it is not our work but His. This the essence and purpose for the Crucified Life.
Unnecessary words can bog your sentences down. I want to glide through prose, not wade through it. If I have to stop and process what’s being said, I’m being pulled out of the story.

Yes, reaching my dreams is still uncertain. Yes, I always go back to square one when I’m living with my parents (forced dependence inside the “Laguna prison”). Yes, I’m jealous of all my batchmates who, at this stage, are either employed at some big company or are enrolled for law school. But those are not reasons to sit around and count crows. I may not be ready for uncertainty, but I’m ready to at least push until my efforts bear fruit.

Butt turned up at the scene on Parr Lane, Unsworth, Greater Manchester, at 11.30am on October 21 last year, shortly after his brother was taken away by police.
None of us can, please believe me, and if perhaps you think you are, I'm sure there is a slack somewhere. And more than likely that slack will be found in the amount of sleep you're getting Mom. Not good.
Let’s catch up on the background. Paul is in Jerusalem speaking to a great crowd of angry Jews; angry, because Paul was not doing what they thought he should be doing. They were jealous because he was going to the Gentiles without their blessing. It was only by the grace of God that he was now able to speak to them. In his message he was showing them that God gave him this commission.

The police of course will use the stat of the cop death to justify drawing their guns quicker, & using SWAT raids more.
So what does this have to do with clothing? Well, the first staple we talked about is your wide shot. If you have the right suit, all the details we addressed will fade into the background and just give off the presentation of a well-made, well-fitting suit.
And so we come finally the story of the movie. Its obvious Seve Schelenz as a precise idea what he wants to be shown, and yet the presentation of the story is both the movies strength and the ultimate weakness of this movie. People will watch this movie and adore everything, the reveal at the end will get them talking, and theories will be talked about days after. It may seem simple to begin with but to really delve into the richness of the story you have to do the work yourself, this movie doesn’t hold your hand and doesn’t serve up answers easily. Yet at what point does a film move from being subtle with its answers and just being frustrating? Thinking of this movie in reference to the mass audience, I can see people getting to the end and hating the movie.
Maybe I need to use Craig's List. Yeah, I'll hire someone to figure out what the fuck this pile of paper says and translate it into legible notes.

Autoeczematization (or autosensitization) is a reaction pattern in which eczematous disease elsewhere on the skin induces “metastatic” eczematous lesions at some distant spot. The hands, particularly the palms and fingers, are frequently involved in this reaction. A vesicular component that resembles dyshidrosis is often expose. A diagnosis of autoeczematization is likely: (1 ) if vesiculation is explosive in onset, (2) if there is minimal grouping of the vesicles, and most importantly, (3) when marked eczematous disease is found on the feet or elsewhere on the body.
This whole week has been a whirlwind full of things, things, and more things. On the writing front, I'm closing in on 23,000 words of my new novel (which fills me with SUCH glee), but...this post is about dancing! And on Tuesday night we had what was our best, most amazing, most energetic tribal expo yet! If you're friends with me on facebook (WHAT? You're not? :( Friend me?) you've probably seen the pictures I posted.

Heat up pot and put in some vegetable oil. Sauté onions and garlic until golden brown. Add in cinnamon stick, star anise and cloves. Stir fry for a short while. Put in the curry, fennel, turmeric and cumin paste. Pour some water into the pot; add the egg plant and dhall beans. Bring to a boil and turn the heat to low. Let it simmer for around 1 hour. Add carrot, tomato, long beans and potato. Bring to a boil and let it simmer for another 10 minutes. Pour in the tamarind juice and add salt to taste. Serve with roti chanai, rice, puri, chapati or plain bread.

Darth Spoilboy over the course of the entire Christmas break brought up the fact that he had wanted to keep those toy soldiers. Now I mean no harm about this but my wife is not the sentimental type, if anything she is far more Vulcan than Spock when it comes to getting rid of anything she feels is useless and just taking up space. God help me, but there have been more than a few times she has given me a very curious look like she was contemplating the logic in kicking me out onto the street so I told my son to just suck it up.

I was surprised to discover last year that Bangladesh is not a particularly unequal place. But if we take that data at face value — and I see no reason to think that the statisticians are grossly, fundamentally getting Bangladesh wrong — then Strukhoff’s finding shouldn’t come as a surprise.
Yet another witness claims that Joyce was seen with the leadpiping, heading towards the Study, where Stuart Andrew was reading with his back to the door and his ears covered by mufflers, so they didn’t get cold.
If you are from the UK (or from anywhere elsewhere in the world), it seems very wise to me not only to consult a specialist who understands your “origin” situation, but also to consult a Belgian specialist as you will find out that inheritance law can be very different from country to country and this might actually result in having to draft not one will that covers all your assets but a will in each country where you have assets may be helpful.
We are now stuck in a holding pattern until our own government gives us permission to have our children. They are ours. They bear our name. They are no longer considered orphans in Ethiopia because they have parents (Us!). Yet the US Embassy will not allow them travel authorization to enter the country and live with us in Kentucky. There are many who are saying the State Department is opposed to international adoptions on ideological grounds. Thus, they are intentionally derailing or at least detaining adoptions. I don’t know for sure what is happening. But I do know we are waiting.
On December 15, 1911 King George v laid the foundation stone for New Delhi. Now 100 years after its inception the national capital of Delhi has overspilled its boundaries and has layers within layers. On one hand it is aggressive competitive energetic and violent and on the other vibrant colorful seeped in nostalgia and old world charm.
Heavy-handed shit, like a roller coaster ride, has obvious cues such as big explosion and exciting dum dum dum music to make you feel afraid or excited intuitively. Sure, these feelings are only temporary and empty but that temporary moment is definitely gratifying. Heavy-handed shits are always exciting if you go with their flow and not get annoyed by the fact that they are treating you like an idiot by telling you how you should feel.
Favorite? I had a lot of them in my creative life. At first the idea is born in my head, it sits there for some time and then when the time is right I start to create and get totally involved into the process. My husband complains sometime that I am not there with him when I sew. I love fabric ( to the point that I can get almost sick from the excitement of being in a good fabric shop).

He was spotted in 1900 by a William Morris agent in St. Louis and thence booked for the Orpheum and Keith circuits. From 1900-14, he crisscrossed the globe many times, performing not only in Europe but also in such far flung place as Australia and South Africa (which is where he first met Will Rogers). In these years, he literally played before the Crowned Heads of Europe, further adding to the Fields mystique. During the years of the world tour he became a dumb act, to avoid the difficulties of the language barrier. While a non-verbal Fields may seem difficult to imagine, one must keep in mind what an adept physical comedian he was. He was a first rate pantomimist, and that skilled was honed during these years.
As always with patent claims, not to mention advertisements proffering dubious ‘guarantees’, for even more dubious ‘miracle cures’, it is important to pay attention to the precise wording: in this case ‘practised and applied’, ‘in the courts of this country’, ‘where appropriate’, ‘settled jurisprudence’. Terrell is not just unapologetically Anglo-centric, it is almost entirely court-centred. Unlike The Modern Law of Patents, in particular, Terrell has no pretensions as a source of reference for patent office practitioners (whether in Newport or Munich), and the Munich case law is expressly included for its relevance to UK law and practice, rather than for its intrinsic importance. Does all this mean that Terrell's editors have failed to deliver on what they promised? I think not, since Terrell holds up a faithful mirror to what has been the policy of the Patents Court since the days of Falconer and Aldous JJ, both editors of Terrell themselves. They (and Terrell) have done their best to see that English law has marched to the same tune as European law, but not to the extent of slavishly following in anyone else's footsteps.

Here’s the problem – a lot of this stuff was already on Poincare’s notes and manuscripts – actually a really really really lot of it! Some say that is proof of nothing because Einstein was a genius, the man of the century, and incidentally he was a sex maniac for what it’s worth. Einstein insisted he never read other scientists papers, that it muddied his thought process and was counterproductive to original thought. Here’s the thing, Einstein belonged to an organization known as the Olympia Academy, and what they studied often and at great depth was Poincare.

On reading the situation of the coming US plans for Total Global War, Putin spelt out an alliance to integrate the former Soviet Republics into closer cooperation. He scheduled an emergency trip to China to meet with Hu, and ordered the FSB (Russian Agency) to notify China’s MSS of the arrest and detention of their spy Tun Sheniyun who was captured last year for attempting to steal sensitive information on Russia’s most powerful anti-aircraft system.
I would call each of you who read this BLOG today to stop what you’re doing and pray. Pray for your family, those you work with, your church. Pray for protection and peace and that we would be surrounded by a host of heavenly messengers. Pray for our country and our leaders. Prayer is our offensive weapon and we should target the local covens during these days. We should take care to pray especially for those pastors who are unaware of what is lurking in their own communities. Finally, we should be on guard, for our enemy goes about like a roaring lion seeking whom me may destroy. The battle is real and we must learn to engage! PRAY!
The Trinity is not the Trinity because of us. The Trinity has been and always will be. We are what we are because the Trinity has willed it so.

After holiday indulgences, I was ready for some healthy soup. Something hot and filling. I must mention here that our downstairs heater decided not to work on this day so cooking was a good way to stay warm. We do have a wood burning fireplace and thank goodness we had some wood. The downstairs was hovering in the 50 degree range for which I am thankful. It was not the same temperature as outside. It was cold and it was snowing which by default makes one colder and it was the day after Christmas and we were getting snowed in and I had already cooked enough. Seriously.
I found a shoulder to lean on
We tell about this in such detail, because the expectation is at the heart of every game situation. When the bookie calls from football fans bet $ 11 to win $ 10, he has a positive expectation of 50 cents per its $ 10. When the casino pays even money for your blackjack when the dealer’s ace, it has a positive expectation about $ 3.85 with rates of $ 100 as of 13 surrenders blackjack dealer will happen 4 times and 9 times does not happen. Paying your 1:1 13 times casinos will lose $ 1300, and playing 4 times a draw and paying your Blackjack 9 times 3:2, it will lose $ 1350. In 13 similar games save $ 50!

With Song critique session first half, followed by Guest Speaker: Songsalive! holds workshops where songwriters gather to share their songs, gain feedback and develop relationships within the songwriting communities we have created around the world. The first half is solely dedicated to an in-the-round workshop where writers present one song each - either on tape, CD or live followed by a guest speaker/industry discussion in the second half and plenty of time to talk and network. Moderated by Paul Lawrence Moyer.

Z rolled out of bed begging to 'go somewhere', so I bundled up the kids and took them with me. I had decided to be a volunteer, so we were going at 9:30. (Volunteers get to split up the extras!)

Thanks for the great run. It will always be a special time to me.
I still like the price mechanism. Why not a pub smoking tax? Establishments that allow smoking would pay a per-seat premium to the state for that privilege (funds to be used to pay for education and health programs related to smoking). Further I think smoking establishments should be required to provide full health insurance benefits to all employees, even part-timers, and maybe a wage premium, too.
In the light American lager catagory, I think this might be the best entry of them all. Light amber color with a slight amount of head. There is a nice hop flavor but not overwhelming like an IPA or APA. There was also a hint of caramel flavor. This was such a refreshing and clean tasting beer. It can easily be drank a few at a time with no issues.
Second, the conscious destruction of fatherhood. While not all of these rioters come from broken homes — yes, the term is most applicable — many of them have no strong, male figure to look to, and even when a father is present he is often emasculated. We have lionized the single mother and made the role of the dad who provides boundaries and consequences to actions a figure of fun, a dinosaur.
Yeah yeah yeah I know, I should speak to someone about that / sort my shit out / unfuck myself over but that is a helluva lot harder than just buying the wood to make a bridge.
Another day, I was on the phone, trying to write down what PhoneMan was delivering to me when suddenly, a tourist walked into the store. My phone began to slip from my face. He was a deluxe tourist. His hair was inky black and pulled back in a greasy ponytail with a rubber band. His beard was long and white like Santa Clause, which matched his physique perfectly. He had many pens stuffed in his man-breast pocket, which left little pools of ink on his pit-stained polo-shirt. The most magnificent thing about him was his fanny pack that had not one, but TWO cup holders. He was waving a rusty bayonet haphazardly through the air while smiling like he had just brought me something I was really going to enjoy. I ignored him and asked PhoneMan to repeat his question.
This marks the first Christmas video release from the iconic Travis, who launched his career in 1986 with the triple-Platinum-selling CD, Storms of Life. His 1987 follow-up, Always & Forever, went on to sell five million copies, cementing his position in country music history as he went on to become the first country music artist to achieve multi-Platinum status. Travis has released 20 albums total including two Christmas albums, 2007’s Songs of The Season and 1989’s Gold-selling An Old Time Christmas. His most recent release, Around The Bend, hit streets in July of this year, debuting at #3 on Billboard’s Country chart and #14 on the Albums chart.

Whenever people have asked me if I've read David Copperfield I've always said yes, but never felt easy about doing so: it feels like part of my psyche - especially my writing psyche - but it's so long since I read it, and I was only a child, surely it can hardly count; surely if I read it again I'd find it a completely different experience from the one I remember?

Let’s put ourselves back in Abraham’s family’s shoes….They did not know about Abraham’s intentions the day he was to sacrifice his son. Let’s now imagine that somebody followed him to the mountain and see what he is about to do…. How would that person react? How would you react?
As people who enjoy fitness and a healthy lifestyle, we all know some days are better than others. Most days are great. We are inclined to eat healthy and going to workout is almost second nature. We relish the fact that we can push our bodies to new heights continuously and love the way we feel afterward. There are also those days we don’t feel as motivated and we “try” to workout. In the words of the old and wise Yoda, “Do or do not, there is no try”.
"I'll just have some green tea and a sit down first", I thought. Then looked at the TV Times while drinking said tea and found that the "Young musician of the year" semi final was on, and that was the end of that.
There have been a few events this month that have left me feeling proud, honored, excited, motivated and happy. Today was one of those days. We had our first Charity Ride at Fly to raise money for Charity Water. We took the bikes outside for the first time, over to the hotel across the way. There were volunteers, donated coffee and pastries, an amazing DJ to spin during our ride and we raised over $2000!!! It was just......pure awesome. I have been teaching cycling for a little over 6 months and it has become my favorite class ever. There really is something magical about teaching that class. I think because for me, that is one of the few places I can really LET GO. I ride that bike and feel so connected to my body and the music. I can clear my mind, forgive myself for anything, feel strong and powerful, feel emotions that I need to feel. Today, I taught a class way out of my comfort zone. I had a mic for the first time, we were outside on the waterfront, it was a big event. I was so nervous but oh so excited. I am just proud of myself for today... I put that mic on and just felt good. The music was bumpin, the class was pumped up, the vibe was one of a kind. There was a breeze that kept coming through the tent and every time it did, I thought of my mom. There is a poem she wrote before she died and it says, "the breeze on your cheek is me." That wind would come through our tent and I knew without a doubt that she was there. She was probably sayin, "you go girl!"

From where we sit (in a plush purple love sac) being educated means being able to understand the question presented and thoroughly knowing enough relevant information to make a reasoned argument.

So to sum everything up we need to see how this market plays out for the remainder of April and into early-May before definitively declaring that April was a high and that a steep correction lies ahead. Sentiment and technicals just don’t seem to support 2012 being a repeat of 2010 and 2011. As I have said in the past week I am cautious, but I’m not bearish. I’m looking for support on the Nasdaq Composite between 2862 and 2900. If that is broken it is okay but not preferred. If the October 2011 high of 2753 is breached that would be cause for concern.

When I started this blog almost a year ago, I didn't plan on posting every day. It was just meant to be a place to share information that I found in my search for information for my Defeating Cancer Through Education Facebook page, but that wasn't really cancer-related. I didn't however plan to only have twelve posts in a year. Posting 2-4 times a month would be closer to my goal. I got wrapped up in other things and neglected this blog a bit. I have two posts right now that I've been working on and need to sit down and write. I'm grateful for those who have taken the time to read this blog and will have more great information to share (more frequently) in the future.

As minutes stretched into what seemed an eternity of alcohol-induced anguish Jack’s mind completed the reboot process allowing thoughts that were more complex. After realizing he was not actually dead he became aware of the sun peeking through the slates of the shutters covering his windows and the spin of the ceiling fan in the center of his bedroom.
Still holding the back of my head, he grabs me by the hair and yanks me head first onto the bed. He calls me a stupid fucking whore, a dirty pig whore. He grabs for my underwear but ends up ripping the hem of my dress. That makes him even more furious. His hand grabs my foot, pulls me towards him, he rips off my underwear, moves in between my legs and tries to get inside me, but can’t. I didn’t make him wet enough with my saliva. I ruined it. The spit stings, but he is inside. I can leave this room now. He will get what he wants and I can focus on the back of my eyelids.
In response to my last question on CSIR’s revenue sharing policies with its employees, we were given a copy of some guidelines on the point. The guidelines however seem to govern only consultancy or third-part funded research. This would basically cover the Patent Office-CSIR agreements for recruiting patent examiners and conducting prior art research. A part of this money from the Patent Office deals goes directly to CSIR employees. The guidelines do not seem to cover the transfer of royalties from public funded research. The Indian version of the Bayh-Dole Bill is likely to cover this aspect. However given the lack of transparency at CSIR, I would think that the Government may want to add additional safeguards to the draft version of the Bill.

If, when negotiating for entry into the Common Market, they will make it clear to the other countries concerned that such entry on the part of Great Britain will be possible only if we retain the right to withdraw from such an association at a later date, on due notice given, and under previously agreed conditions, should it be subsequently found that continued membership would be dangerous, or prejudicial, to our national prosperity or way of life.

Annette had been a student at University College, Swansea (formerly Sketty Anglers Club) long enough to have shed her Saxon, secular resistance to the direct and deeply spiritual sensibility of the Cambrian aesthete. And Swansea is where you are most likely to encounter this Epicurean approach at its most expressive:

The cornerstone of allopathic treatment for ovarian cancer is surgery. The goal is to remove as much of the cancer as possible. Chemotherapy, which involves the use of anticancer drugs to kill the cancer cells, is usually administered after the surgery to destroy any remaining cancer.

The more I use the Pilot Drawing Pen, the more I keep trying to find something that I don't like about it. Truth is, there really isn't much not to like. My only real gripe is that the line is just slightly less clean and consistent compared to the Sakura Pigma Micron and the Copic Multiliner. In a drawing pen, I want that sharpness, and therefore the Pilot falls in line just behind the other two. It's really a decent pen though.

Or to have someone call you over to say they’d never even heard of a Kolsch before tonight – and where can I get some more?! Even to see a hardened old VB stalwart (who only ever buys stubbies and not cans and never anything BUT VB) have even a few sips of Hightail, half a glass of Hefeweizen a mere sniff of an APA made the night worthwhile. To hear that he had three pots of Kolsch had me dancing on the table!
But it’s not just business. Just like corporations, public sector groups have early retired, laid off, and reassigned positions to junior teams, reducing their overhead and payroll loads. I heard another shining example of that today.
Mabry currently is home to the Texas Military Forces Academy, the Officer Candidate School, a Non-Commissioned Officers Academy, the Texas National Guard Armory Board, the offices of the Adjutant General, the headquarters of the Texas Air National Guard and Texas State Guard, and a variety of other state and national military-related operations.
I really shouldn't have stressed. We already had things boxed up and ready from our last sale. All I did this time was clean out a closet of old shoes, boots and winter clothes. Basically, John loaded the vehicle this morning, I gathered the money for making change and a few copied images of larger furniture we weren't able to bring but hoped to sell, and we headed off for the grand event at quarter to seven this morning. By 12:30 we were done and home with $135 in profits (and a piece of furniture pending for another $15).

There were some wonderful statements Herd makes along the way that are worth chewing on for a while. Here are a few:
The main plot is set at no particular time, but resembles the middle- ages, with kings, queens, peasants, and other miscellaneous characters. It is fictional, having magic, folklore, and mystical creatures that you may only dream of. The main character is named Shadow, a fifteen-year-old fairy whom is compelled to tell the truth. She is most unusual, with her blue eyes and black hair, unlike all the other fairies who have brown eyes and either brown or blonde hair. Her best friends, Cider and Wheat, always try to make her have fun, and misuse her powers for simple pleasure, ending in a loss of their friendship.

Seventeen-year-old Lochan and sixteen-year-old Maya have always felt more like friends than siblings. Together they have stepped in for their alcoholic, wayward mother to take care of their three younger siblings. As defacto parents to the little ones, Lochan and Maya have had to grow up fast. And the stress of their lives—and the way they understand each other so completely—has also also brought them closer than two siblings would ordinarily be. So close, in fact, that they have fallen in love. Their clandestine romance quickly blooms into deep, desperate love. They know their relationship is wrong and cannot possibly continue. And yet, they cannot stop what feels so incredibly right. As the novel careens toward an explosive and shocking finale, only one thing is certain: a love this devastating has no happy ending.

If you are not familiar with “Doing the Dada” or “Kicking Out The Epic Mother Fucker” or going “Bananas” or drinking mass amounts of Champaign, then you are obviously not familiar with Dada Life. One of the most high energy acts you can possibly witness and this proved true again at Coachella. They debuted a new track that I believe is called “Do The Dada” which was absolutely insane. Dada earned the # 3 spot for day 3 and it was epic to see them rock out in a festival setting.
Their business model works thusly: businesses pay Kidzania to set up stores and other businesses in the park. We, the public, pay Kidzania to go in and role play in these stores. Genius, eh?

8. Danny Boy (2001) - The Irish Tenors
One of my colleagues asked me what I'm thankful for and I mentioned a few things, including my internship and being able to live in Paris. I am also grateful for the roof over my head, clothes on my back, shoes on my feet, food in my stomach, and almost-perfect health. When I tell Europeans I'm from New York, there is always the same reaction - gasp, shock, smile, followed every single time by "I love New York!" (unless they haven't been, to which they respond "Going to New York is my dream". As my uncle once said, "no it's not - it's a ticket"). So needless to say, I am thankful for being a "yankee". I am beyond thankful for my family and friends, although this really doesn't need to be said because it's a given. Even the friends who have brought nothing but negative energy into my life, I thank you because you made me who I am today. I am grateful to the people who have doubted me- whether it was my graduating high school earlier, studying abroad, and especially moving to Paris. You are the motivation and drive I feed off of to be successful and go for my dream, no matter how elaborate. I am thankful to be a child of Italian immigrants and have the luxury of sharing my time between two continents, spending quality time with relatives who decided to stay behind in their home country and watch their families disappear across the horizon. I am grateful for stories - oral tradition - from older members of my family- stories of war, poverty, death, traditions, hobbies, friendships. Stories that will eventually be lost to the past, never to be spoken of again.

Sorry I've been MIA for so long - my classes at school got over yesterday (actually Wednesday because yesterday we caroled in the halls for choir and watched "Dolphin Tale" which by the way, is the sweetest movie ever. I laughed and cried and loved it!! I'll be doing a review on it sometime next week (along with some book reviews) over at my other/new blog, The Media Mix . I have a feeling that I'm going to be doing a lot of things next week (including some long over-due posts; sorry for the lack of reading material on here) so we'll see what I end up getting done. We're going to try and get the Christmas/New Year's letter and picture(s) out next week - we didn't do a letter or picture last year, so I really wanted to do one this year. After all, it's my last year home and I did quite a few things last summer that I want people to know about (bragging? maybe a little...:)
Electromagnetic Pulse Attack
Right up until we headed to Reliquary of Souls. For those of you who didn’t experience the walk to RoS, a brief explanation: it was a gauntlet down a long hallway full of ghosts. You’d run as a tight group, AoE the ones you pulled, run again, and AoE again. And you would never, ever, ever attack the mobs before the tank called for AoE. Good raiders don’t attack before they’re told to.
It always amazes me when artists of any genre show no interest in, or knowledge of, other art forms. For me, every kind of art informs and enriches all the others. Not only do I find it fully possible to dance about architecture, I don't even understand why this might be construed as difficult. I'm not a musician, and I like it that way; music provides at least one source of pure inspiration and enjoyment, informing my work in the most direct way. I do not and cannot paint when I don't have music playing; sometimes I'll wake up with a start and realize that I have been staring at a canvas for 45 minutes without moving, simply because the CD ended.

Southern Tier IPA is an American beer. This cloudy beer had a small head and nearly no carbonation. In the nose there was some assertive grapefruit, and the grapefruit also dominated in the mouth. The finish was bitter with a touch of grass. This was a great India Pale Ale and my favourite of these three.
Ok, so I'm still not putting the pieces together. I am thinking it's still about "communication"... only, on a grander scheme. When, actually, it's about the grand finale of my communication era... before I move on to greater things. Ok, so I learned to talk. Now, let's see if I can "navigate"... navigate my own course. Let's add, to that, "charting my own course"... charting the course that I intend to navigate... instead of having someone else chart my course, and call all the shots.
That’s a tough one! There are so many!

Once I have the children in small groups, I try to show the children the relationship that many of the letter sounds have to the letter names. For example, the sound of the M and its letter name have a definite connection, so these letters will be easier for them to learn. The “Sounds to Letters” song on the Singable Songs for Letters and Sounds CD/DVD is also useful for establishing this connection.

I’m sure if we could put ourselves in the shoes of King, now 47, who must continue to live in the shadow of the beating he took from the four cops in 1991. This event fueled an already heated racial tension that existed in Southern California, particularly between the African American community and the Los Angeles Police Department.
The yogic system is designed to switch off our analytic minds and encourage our meditative mind. Equally practice encourages the parasympathetic nervous system to do its job, namely relax the bodymind complex. The asanas if well taught will trigger various nerve centres particularly in the lumbar spine, pelvis and pelvic floor if relaxed enough a woman can orgasm. The female orgasm is a complex matter. Truth be known yoga can make a person feel extremely orgasmic in themselves, this is when the yoga student is moving away from yoga as a form of exercise and yoga as it is truly meant meaning Union with the self, I am not surprised many women actually orgasm when they relax enough to meet themselves.

My hunch is that this is because we aren't evolved to life in large groups. Our brains were evolved to live peacefully (relatively) in fairly small groups. Most anthropologists and psychologists I know use ~200 as rough estimate by looking at historical data and examining tribal groups today. We're not evolved to live in groups of 1,000,000,000,000 or whatever size city you happen to reside. Our brains just don't work that way. It is difficult to try to get with that many people. Rarely will I say this, but thank goodness for a larger infrastructure (government) that keeps us relatively well-behaved and functional.
The 230-meter (754-ft) coal tanker Shen Neng 1 was carrying 65,000 tons of coal to China, with 975 tons of heavy fuel oil on board. Based on all the information available, and in all probability, the vessel could break apart causing an even larger disaster.
Tyler Cowen has framed it like this:
The life of the mind flayer begins and ends in the tank of the Elder Brain. As little tadpoles, they're placed in its tank, where it feeds off their psychic energy. Those who survive get to become fully formed mind flayers. At the end of an mind flayer's life, the brain is removed from the creature's head and placed in the tank, where it's absorbed by their leader.

According to this article, ostracism cuts deeper and lasts a lot longer than any physical pain. It is like a form of bullying that does not leave bruises on us. Also, there are three stages in ostracism and they are the actual act of being excluded, coping and resignation. Man, can I relate to these. During the first stage, people have learned that they have been left out and are hit with the harsh reality. The pain is there and is real. So, instead of moving on, many times we move to the second stage to cope. During this phase, we start acting out in ways that will garner acceptance. It is like going against what you believe or selling your soul to these people in some respect. I see a lot of Queen Bee’s use a lot of bargaining during this phase. This is why these abusers have so many followers. They do not want to be excluded. However, if still being excluded and have been coping and getting nowhere, people will generally turn towards aggressive means or they give up completely. This is known as resignation. If the person has tried hard enough and still cannot get that acceptance, they take it into their own hands or just move on. I believe this is where school shooters come in. They have tried, worked hard, followed, sold their soul and done everything but still nothing changes. So, they take things into their own hands. Folks, a person can only take so much until they snap.

But I believe I found happiness here, and I believe I should stay, at least for a time. I mean, not staying because of the place, I'm staying for one person. I think I couldn't survive far from him, I'd be very lost without him.

Diving into self-publishing in April changed all of that, and in a few days I will finally publish this novel. I had planned to publish in the summer, but a dalliance with the wrong editor set me back some. I then sent the MS to my current (superb) editor, almost as a cry for help. She quickly stopped me running in the wrong direction, and gave clear, detailed advice about what was strong, and what needed work.

Breivik is not an implacable foe of multiculturalism; he is a product of it. He is multiculturalism’s monster, where his true aim is to win recognition of his identity alongside all those other identities that are fawned over in modern Europe. In essence, his barbarous act last year was not about dismantling multiculturalism but about expanding it, to make sure it afforded respect to his own petty cultural feelings as well as everyone else’s.

Your hot water heater represents about 20-30% of the carbon emissions of your home, the biggest user of energy in your house. Consider setting your hot water thermostat to 120°F. Insulate your hot water tank with an insulation jacket if available for your system. Arrange for your boiler to be serviced so it runs more efficiently. When you next replace your boiler, consider a condensing boiler - they use less fuel than conventional boilers to produce the same amount of heat and can save 32% on fuel bills.

Besides foretelling an increase in pollution, these figures make it abundantly clear that providing shore power for visiting ships should be well within reach financially. Based on an article presented on the C40 Cities website, for cruise ships berthed in Seattle, which provides shore power, running cost per call was approximately $5,000. Granted, electric rates are lower in the Northwest. But, using these numbers, the projected 264 calls in NY would cost a total of $1.32M. That works out to about $2.05 per projected passenger. Even if the cost was 5x higher, it would total about $10 per passenger.

Some of them are downright hostile when Iris announces that she wants to do something to honor Iris’s memory but which one of them actually killed her? This is the question that Annie is determined to answer, even if it puts her own life in jeopardy.

You could have been told in elementary school by some kid that “you can’t be part of our group.” And you may have accepted this and recorded the thought of “I can’t be part of the group.” And you may be all grown up now and wondering why you shy away from working in groups! Well, this thought may still be playing around inside of you and causing you to feel uncomfortable working in groups! Double yikes!
LS: That’s an amazing question. I really couldn't tell the difference for a long time, but when I look back at old scripts, I can see how things got ignored. I still think it's important to write what's in your head, because even if it doesn't get produced, it could end up being your best sample of your voice. Even though I liked exploring characters, it took a long time for me to figure out structure. I still grapple with it. A book called "The Writer's Journey" and a very patient Dana Fox taught me some phrases and tricks. I still resist convention between the second and third act, which accounts for the change in pace in "Nick and Norah's" as well as "Seeking A Friend.” I think it's most important to concentrate on theme and tone. Those will make your story distinct and reveal the "trailer moments" of your script. After that, I think pacing is key. Hearing a script out loud is a good indicator of its possibilities.

By reviewing tour packages you can customize your vacation and avail loads of advantages.
Damn, Mandy thought. Ruby Mountain was just upstream from Brown’s Canyon, a rushing series of Class III and IV rapids that was the most popular whitewater rafting run on the upper Arkansas River. If the man’s fishing waders filled up and he was washed into the canyon, his chances were slim to none. Worried it might be someone she knew, Mandy asked, “What’s the man’s name?”
White Pads. Most nibs wrote smoothly, but the paper tend to absorb ink, resulting in severe bleedthrough and nibs tending to write broader lines than on other papers, but without the ink actually feathering much. As I wrote in my review (which, technically was of some discontinued pads that may differ from the current Freeleaf variety), for the limited uses I had for the pads, I could live with the bleedthrough, so that performance deficit was outweighed by the smooth writing experience.

The following week my apartment became a hotel for a few days while my friend Megan was in town. She cooked quesedillas (with real American salsa!) for me and kept the dirty dishes out of my kitchen sink. Then we were off to Hannover, for a weekend of reliving our grad school days, including tuna melts and towers of beer, people watching at 2 for 1 beer night, karaoke and rickety carnival roller coasters.
With a little judicious editing, Zodiac could have been a much more compelling film. As is, it’s interesting to see a director of such technical proficiency branch out a bit, and Fincher captures good performances from his male-heavy cast, particularly Mark Ruffalo. (Though he doesn’t work with women often, I think two the most sucessful performances in Fincher films have come from Jodie Foster and Sigourney Weaver.) But if the film is supposed to be suspenseful or frightening, it fails on both counts, and it lacks both the tightness of a true procedural drama or the substance of a character ensemble. In short, Zodiac isn’t quite sure what kind of film it’s supposed to be.

Since springtime, the girls have been practicing a dance in their Chinese dance class that they take weekly. In early December, the girls performed their dance in a competition in Los Angeles, CA and received gold trophies for their efforts (which is really 2nd place).

The enemies of freedom are not so stupid to try and take our freedom(s) in a big, bold action. It is more effective to cook the American voter like the slowly boiled frog. Unexamined sayings like “from the get-go” are a symptom of the slow creep of authoritarianism, socialism and Marxism into our daily American lives.

I understand that our driving goal and vision is size and numbers. I get that. I also realize that a committed Christian life is not for everyone and that if we make authentic discipleship our goal, we will lose a lot of people and attract fewer. I can understand the low expectations and I even understand why people are downgrading discipleship to be open to all. In 1998, I conducted a survey that showed that 71% of United Methodist’s defined discipleship as “believing that Jesus is God’s Son.” All that has happened is that this has now been adopted as the UM standard. It really helps us live with our mission of “making disciples of Jesus Christ for the transformation of the world.” As long as discipleship is defined in simplistic, non-demanding terms the church doesn’t have to get serious about changing. What we are already doing is good enough.

Another attempt at a World’s largest but a different category than a claw game, an iPhone controlled game. Hyundai set-up a huge iPhone controlled game at buzzing Times Square, New York on a huge billboard. What I liked about this particular activity was that it involved the users to register and download an app to play the game. Hyundai provided Wi-fi at Times Square to connect users to play the game. This is a great opportunity to capture data of the people playing the game and use it for follow-ups later on.

Since I'm teaching a class on lucet weaving at Costume College this year, I felt I had to put rubber to the road, so the speak. So, the straps and front of the stays are laced with standard lucet cord, made from cotton crochet cord, and the back is laced with double lucet cord. I think the cord is certainly sturdy enough for this application...I just need to get all the stretch out.

We rode without stopping from the bridge over the Elbow River near Fort Calgary to Harvie Passage, another big City project that has replaced an extremely dangerous weir built in 1904 to divert water for agriculture. The river structures that will allow for much safer rafting, tubing, canoeing and kayaking look pretty much finished. Signage and landscaping still need to be completed. We found a unique Brass Cap here and then continued into Pearce Estate Park to put new log sheets into two geocaches we placed in 2008 for publication concurrent with our second WWFM event. The traditional cache has been found almost 200 times while there are fewer than 100 finds for the multi-cache that requires geocachers to walk / bike the trails in Pearce Estate Park to learn all about wetlands in order to work out the coordinates for the container.

Bos Stefan came over to build a shelf. You see his assistant in the photo and bos Niko. They are sawing and fitting and nailing but everyone is saying to me "So you're building a shelf?" meanwhile I'm lounging on a chair (albeit with the feverish Gabriela draped over me). This comment used to drive me cRRRazy especially when cooks would say to me: "You're making Haitian chicken and pikliz?" and then I'd give them money and they would take a bath, put on fancy clothes, go to the market, bargain for everything, carry it home including the live chicken, wash and chop and grate everything into identical pieces without a cutting board, kill, pluck, and boil the chicken, stand for hours tending several bubbling pots, wash the dishes and set them out, arrange the food in serving bowls...wash the dishes, go home, make more food, wash more dishes. This is the Haitian chicken that I !!!! was making. On the other hand, we all know that the chicken like the rice that will steam beside it, is not just mine, never was and never will be. Here in Haiti, where work is done outside, often on the street if not viewable from it, it's more obvious to everyone where things come from and where they go. The chickens are part of the daily symphony called dawn and later walk threw the neighborhoods in generous baskets on the top of market ladies heads. I buy rice directly from farmers that i know and whose fields i've visited. Anyone who has been to Haiti knows that the Haitian cook can not help cooking for a crowd, a hungry crowd!, and that there will be parts of the savory free-range chicken that no one in my little family will want to eat, like some organs, and if we're nice we'll give these out in foresight with the extra rice. The chicken bones will get sucked and any last meaty morsels will feed someone's dog.

And, since all Human beings are sinful by nature, it becomes necessary to verify all that we say & claim. After all, it is the Prophet (Peace be upon him) himself, who has said, “If people were allowed to make baseless-claims, they would take the lives & wealth of others indiscriminately. However, the clarity is upon the claimant, otherwise they must take an oath.”.(An-Nawawi) This statement makes it very clear, that we are not allowed to just say things without them being truthful. We are obligated to have all that we claim to be honest, as well as verifiable. Muhammad (Peace be upon him) has also said, “The life, property & integrity of a Muslim is sacred.”.(An-Nawawi) This obviously means that no one has the right to take your life, property, or ruin your reputation, unless there is an Islamically justifiable reason to do so, and in almost all cases, you have to dig pretty damn deep, in order to find any Islamic justification to take someone’s life, property, or destroy their reputation; and, even the lives, properties & integrity of Non-Muslims are protected under Islamic-Law.

One time I went to a free tv taping for some Japanese tv show at the now demolished London Astoria. The gig was so loud that afterwards I have a memory of my friend and I shouting at each other in Virgin Megastore on Oxford street (which I think is also gone now), with most other people in there looking at us. We didn’t realise we were shouting. The ringing in our ears was blocking it out. Still there was a good version of “Night vision” and an awe inspiring version of “the man don’t give a f*ck”, which sent the Astoria’s legendary bouncy floor, a bouncing. Short of them coming out as Nazi’s or racists, it was hard not to love them after that.

I have always been a night owl. I sleepwalk through most mornings, functioning just enough to get my kids ready for school, and not crash my car into a tree getting them there. Many morning people have tried to convert me, all with no success. Here’s how the conversation usually goes between me and a typical early bird:
Occasionally, the names are thrust upon me. I met a young man named Brantley Fowler at a local Enterprise car rental outlet. I told him I was going to “steal” his name and make him famous. Brantley Fowler is the main character in A Touch of Velvet. His “lady” is a young woman named Velvet Aldridge. Years ago, I had a student named “Velvet.” It was the perfect name for that young lady and for my character.
After that, I got in line to get into the venue to watch Robot and Frank starring Frank Langella and Susan Sarandon (unfortunately, either she said no, the festival couldn't afford her, or they didn't try to get her because she wasn't there...though there was one woman in the audience who resembled her.) It was a cute flick, though it felt a little long. And needed more Susan Sarandon (but I'm biased as I love her like whoa.)
A professional tango dancer said to me that he used to be in shows, once upon a time, but compared to improvisation (and social dancing, even to not very good live music) he just found it painfully boring. I paraphrase, but that was the gist. "Tango is about making mistakes," he said. Apparently he just didn't get the rush from an audience.

Anyway, I know I've said it before but this time I'm finally going back to short fiction--and not just any old short fiction--I'm going to explore flash fiction and have fun writing again. I've ven today enrolled on an online flash-fiction course (Impeccable credentials, of course.) Not for publication or to win prizes although it might lead to something. If it doesn't, so what? I'm still here. I'm still breathing and while I can breathe I will enjoy being alive. And writing is a big part of that for me even if my body does its best to scare me from time to time.

I recognize degrees, and I do not expect unrealistic boycotts, I reply. And some point, we have to draw the line. We have to differentiate and take positions. Other wise everything becomes meaningless.

This means that if you are instructed by a supervisor like the fictional Wally Malvone to engage in dirty tricks and black ops (like those that actually took place under Operation Fast And Furious), you are honor bound to blow the whistle, like the brave ATF Special Agents who remained faithful to their oaths and preserved their integrity. There can be no more of protecting killers because they are federal law enforcement agency "informants," like the members of the Whitey Bulger Irish mob in Boston, or the FBI "informant" who was the likely assassin of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry in Arizona.
This year I decided to try something different. Earlier in the year I took some shots from the Holyrood side of the Radical Road around Salisbury Crags trying to get traffic light trails with a backdrop of the Parliament and Calton Hill. The idea struck me, why not try and combine the two? So that’s what I did. 2 cameras set up, D7000 with the Sigma 70-200mm shooting Calton close in in portrait format, the D90 with the Nikon 18-200mm lens shooting the wide scene on 15s exposures to get the light trails and the fireworks. And guess what? It worked. Exactly the shot I wanted and something I’ve not seen done before.

This is one of the more traditional samplers I've stitched. This was for my friends Lizzie and Andy. There was such a lot of detail in this design and I completely underestimated how long it was going to take me to stitch... I kept putting off starting it and ended up having only three weeks to stitch it over Christmas a couple of years ago... I virtually had to stitch night and day to finish it in time!!! I really love it though, I think it's one of my favourites.

Then, too, the stakes in such places didn’t seem very high when measured against heated Cold War rhetoric that made the prospect of nuclear holocaust a nightmarish possibility. The Eisenhower Administration developed a policy of “massive retaliation” that promised “more bang for the buck.” A Soviet leader promised to bury us. I practiced “duck and cover” drills at school and watched helpful public service announcements on TV that showed me what to do if the Russians dropped an A-bomb on my neighborhood.
Peter Brown sees growth in Late Antique culture, not decay. In classical culture, society, state, and religion are one, Late Antique culture is the beginning of private religions of all types, and the beginning of a definite separation of public and private life. The breakdown of the small city-state with its small city-state religion gives rise of to an independent monolithic world-state. It is a messy time of experimentation and personal exploration which dovetails nicely with Constantine’s conversion of the empire to a supremely personal religion: christianity. The inner life of a citizen is no longer focussed on the state, but is focussed on a personal spirituality: a person’s inner and outer worlds are irrevocably divided now – both are much freer to change without influencing the other. This, according to Brown, is a good thing.

Before you chop up the celery, peel it. This is one of those things I think everyone knows, but given the number of times I get celery strings in my food either at a restaurant or a potluck or whatever, I'm guessing everyone does not know this. So, peel your celery people! It is quick and well worth the extra step!

“Some people would identify this as the choice between the urgent and the important. For me, it’s more a matter of permission.

So I decided to make myself a “creativity pass”! My hope is that it will serve as a tangible reminder to give myself the permission to go ahead and play.

Running long distances is not exactly a social activity and would not seem to be a rich source of anecdotes but Karnazes weaves enough anecdotes into the narrative to make it an enjoyable read even when it is dealing with something I have absolutely to experience.

As inspirational books go this one hits the mark.
Everyone waited, suspended. After several minutes, a few people began to ask what was going on. Is this a drill? Finally the security leader gave the loud ALL CLEAR. And the same answering shouts as personnel returned to their original positions. A security person came to our line and pushed through someone’s luggage and told the person about to approach the exray belt, “This luggage goes through first.” And then everything returned to normal. No explanations. We couldn’t tell what had just happened, except to suspect someone was removed from that line and taken away. We didn’t see the owner of the luggage return.

The post from two weeks ago made me think about the Joiners and all the gigs I went to. Probably the most famous gig that I never went to was the Whiteout and Oasis double headliner. Back in 1994, I had become dissatisfied with the music scene with limited interest in grunge and britpop. I looked backward towards Spacemen 3 and Echo and the Bunnymen instead. My friends told me at the time Whiteout were much better on the evening than Oasis. I would have to take their word on this, as I was not there.

7. Tomb of Laleth. Most of this room is taken up by a octagonal platform. Three steps led up to the platform. The room is lit in an eerie blue fire by a single large brazier in the middle of the platform. Faint ghostly whispers can be heard throughout the tomb. Slowly Laleth the undead revenant of an ancient bard becomes visible. His translucent fingers hold a long, ornately carved flute. His cold lips produce twisted and malevolent sounds of some strange and dreadful enchantment, when four Songhaunts appear out of nowhere and attack while Laleth utters a terrible and blistering curse from the black dephts of his soul. During combat Laleth employs fear invoking sounds, deadly illusions, as well as soul shredding dirges capable of slaying the PC's where they stand. These effects can be countered by a bard. During combat Laleth also tries to possess a PC or NPC with the highest charisma to escape his prision. He tries to kill everybody else.

The wait staff all fussed and pampered them and came over and engaged them in conversation. Yep, they were going to Prom.

They seemed uncomfortable in their “fancy schmancy” clothes, tugging and adjusting and pulling and fussing……

Aside from traditional dance they also had a more playful choreographed dance/skit with dancers dressed in school uniform. I think this was a nod to the portion of the temple dedicated to Thai school, where kids can come to learn their language and culture. There was also of course, like the Thai Town fest, a beauty pageant. The ladies were in gorgeous traditional garb, a sight to behold. Pretty much all of the MC and live entertainment (except where pageant contestants answered in English) was done in Thai, so we weren't entirely sure what everything was about, but loved every minute of it.

A bit distressing (on the edges of the circle) was applied to make the colors more cohesive with the Basic Grey flowers.
The color run, all sorts of wonder follow.
Akhee Ahn : When we first started, we sounded much closer like 70's punk rock. But during several member changes, we've changed a lot. But I think it's getting better. Although I throw away the strict ethos of punk, now I learned how to play more music. But our direction isn't changed. the direction is "making new music for new people".
I became friends with this other guy a week after me and the boy had a chat. He was a bartender and he asked me if I could join his workmates for drinks before me and him both go out to our weekly fix-the gay clubs in the Valley. One of his workmates' cute, he was out of my league.

Widow of John Walton inherited her wealth after the former Green Beret and Vietnam War medic died in an airplane accident near his home in Wyoming 2005. Now world’s richest woman, she got an extra bump in her fortune because of her late husband’s early investment in First Solar; shares up nearly 500% since 2006 initial public offering. But bulk still comes from her holdings in Wal-mart, the retailer founded by her father-in-law Sam Walton and his brother James in 1962. Today Wal-Mart has sales of $405 billion, and employs more than 2.1 million people. The philanthropist supports museums, education and organic

Knowing my guest were not real spicy eaters as we are I found some mild chorizo at a local market known for carrying south American ingredients (great array of cheeses) off Route 27 in South Brunswick. I wrapped thighs around the sausage, and slit open the breasts, then closed them up with toothpicks once I felt the amount of chorizo was sufficient. I mixed together well chopped cilantro, lime juice, corn syrup, brown sugar, salt/lemon pepper, and olive oil for the outside marinade. Leave in mixture for at least hours. I did feel I should have added more brown sugar for a better blackened coating, but it all tasted wonderful.

Spanky waxed philosophical. He's not simply trying to have different beers than other folks in the city, he said, he's following his passion for beer. That is not, as a look at past tappings will show, the same ExTRemE! beer passion so many others have hared off after. He told me he's looking for brewers that are making good beer that don't market it that well. Penn Kaiser Pils would be an excellent example, he noted, and he'd have it if the supply were steady. I like the way he thinks. I get really bored seeing the same great beers everywhere I go.

I am super sorry I did not use one of their cute images but I am waiting to get some copic paper in. I happen to be one of those people that likes to stamp or print off a few images and get started on coloring. I color skin and hair. I try hair combos mostly to see which I like better and try different hair stokes. I must say I bought all of Krista's newest images and went crazy with my last paper. Only to find out I hated the way I colored all their hair except one :(. I have some Neenah Paper which bleeds a lot (I am not an experienced colorer... I know I color good but it normally take one or two tries before I get a finished image). I love X-Press It paper. I need to try some Make It Crafty paper but that is an even longer wait!
In the 1980s she again guested on “The Love Boat” and “Fantasy Island”. Another guest spot was on “Murder She Wrote”. In 1985 she started a 9 month run in the daytime soap Loving playing a tough mother and business woman.
Maoists have claimed responsibility for kidnapping Bosusco Paolo and Claudio Colangelo from a forest on the Kandhamal-Ganjam border on March 14 and demanded the state government to fulfill their demands by Sunday evening. The matter came to the fore on Saturday night following the extremists letting off Sontosh Moharana, a cook, and Kartik Parida, a helper, who had accompanied the Italian duo.
Ugh. Ryan and I searched the helmet box, the manual sheets, and the white envelope, but alas, no decals. A Stormtrooper does not panic, right? So I posted some threads on the Golden Gate Garrison and the First Imperial Stormtrooper Detachment ("FISD") forums for recommendations, given my dire situation. There is Trooperdecals, but he is located overseas and I need the decals before Friday. Ugh.
The girl who sat next to me in the oboe section in band was dating a very young cop when she was a junior in high school, and I guess that stuck with me. I made sure there are towns that employ 19-year-old policemen before I wrote that into the story. I’m always on the lookout for places where adulthood and childhood clash, because that puts a lot of stress on the characters an creates an interesting novel.

Maternity clothes: This past weekend I was convinced that I was officially bumped out. However, today, nada. It’s so insane to me how you can look 4 months pregnant on Monday and not pregnant at all on Tuesday. I blame it on the fact that all of my innards are shifting and perhaps this is making digesting a bit slower. All of the food just sits there creating a faux bump. Oh well, I’ll enjoy these last few weeks of flat bellydom because once I do bump out and can’t even put on socks, I’ll be missing this time of ease!
I will not stop writing, and I sincerely hope that other writers feel the same.
There you see the ideology and nature of the new economic czar. He believes that the government should redistribute wealth in order to reduce poverty by focusing on massive government spending in infrastructure, agriculture, public education, public health, and other welfare programs like breast feeding and food stamps, and control or manage population.
This post is not what you expect. It's not going to waffle on about the advantages or disadvantages of e-books and apps or digital rights. There's enough of that out there already. Instead I am going to tell you what digital really means. There is a lot of mystification going on - some deliberate and some just the result of extensive ignorance.

Prior to FDR, the American people took care of their OWN, family by family, town by town, county by county, state by state. They had NEVER had welfare, and in fact found the very concept of welfare distasteful. And I’m going to tell you right now that they were better, stronger people than we are as a result of that moral superiority and that faith in THE PEOPLE and not the GOVERNMENT.
In the summer I can wake up to a half-messy home and feel good about going outside, swimming, play-dates, and having fun. But something about the cold that makes that impossible for me. I wake up FREEZING, unable to move from under a blanket! I feed the kids anything that I can grab that doesn't require me to go into the cold kitchen for more than 3 minutes, and in the recliner I stay with a great book and slippers until one of the kids starts hollering for more milk. It is then that I realize that this is my last moment of tranquility I will have the rest of the day! Once my leopard print slipper hits that floor it will never return till the next morning!
Ironically there was one more rendition of this song besides the three I’ve written about from Monday. Edgar Winter did an explosive version of his own with some mighty players.

Like any inviolable rule, it must first be broken in order for its nature to be revealed. And this is what our teenage years are for, of course. That intemperate period of our lives in which the visceral passions spew forth and darkness traces its first outline under our eyes. A time when we are all Heathcliffs, when we are crotchety and brooding and questioning of the established order of things.

Now when the people complained in the hearing of the Lord about their misfortunes, the Lord heard it and his anger was kindled. Then the fire of the Lord burned against them, and consumed some outlying parts of the camp. But the people cried out to Moses; and Moses prayed to the Lord, and the fire abated. So that place was called Taberah, because the fire of the Lord burned against them.

Most every horse owner fancies themselves as being a horse trainer and unless they are wanting to do something specialized, most feel there can't be too much to training. Just watching a few shows of the horse fare on TV will make some feel they can go out there and do it themselves. It really doesn't work that way. Modern folk, unless they can devote all day every day working with many different horses, don't have the time, experience or judgement to make a decision as to how to proceed with a horse or even know when a horse has learned and can move on to the next step.

Two hours ago I still had some hope, but I've since given up on that. I thought I saw a bright shiny light, but I don't see it anymore now. To me things seem pretty bleak.

After two weeks, the bruises on my elbows are barely noticeable but my back and right ribcage are still sore. Apart from the physical effects, I am also psychlogically scarred.

Monday morning at 11:00 am my phone rang. I'm not embarrassed to say I was still kind of asleep as last weekend had really worn me out.

Well I am happy to report that it exceeded all of my expectations and then some. The close to one hour-long movie created around the classic song “I only have eyes for you” . Wikipedia tells us that ”I Only Have Eyes for You” is a popular song by composer Harry Warren and lyricist Al Dubin, written in 1934 for the film Dames where it was introduced by Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler. Although I knew the song I did not realize that it is that old and always thought that it was from the 50′s. It just goes to show you how little I know. But lets get back to the Hirshhorn.

I know I say I would make this blog about family but I’m dying to talk about the service also. The service was a wonderful service. It was not a normal funeral service that I would go to , it was like a sunday service were you would sing joyful songs and to me I think that was nice way although it was a sad occasion. Because it taught me that life should celebrate no matter if you are living or dead.

9. II A blown away leaf
School is now officially out for the summer. It’s probably time I just push through this post and get it out there…before summer is over and we enter into a whole other mess of worries and anxieties and issues! This particular blog post has been sitting in my drafts for days and days now. I just haven’t been able to bring myself to fully think through and process the whole thing. I can’t seem to grasp (or don’t want to grasp) the thoughts swirling and spiraling in my head. I am not completely sure why but my guess is because just thinking about it raises my anxiety. If I think about it too much doubt, worries, fears about whether or not we made the right decisions creep in. Worrying and second-guessing come naturally to me so I like to avoid and “stuff” all things which I don’t want to deal with…like then maybe it won’t happen. Denial…I could not possibly be sending my son to all-day, mainstream Kindergarten in August where he will ride the bus, eat lunch and be in a class of TWENTY other children with ONE teacher! All. by. himself!

Start brewing the espresso. Add the remainder of the ingredients to a small saucepan on low and whisk together well. Remove from heat when it warms, but isn’t hot. Pour espresso into a 16 oz mug and then pour cacao mix into the espresso and give a small stir. If you want to make it more of an adult beverage, use a shot of Rumple Minze (or other peppermint schnapps) at the end instead of adding the extract.
Like usual, I was racing the clock on the road. By some miracle, I made it to Calvin College’s confusing campus with nearly 10 minutes to spare, despite having had to make a recordly quick pit stop on the two hour drive (there are some downsides to being too hydrated). Just as I was about to ask a stranger to point me in the right direction my friend Lindsey Slot (otherwise known as Spicy) called. “Hi, Grace! I’m at the Faith & Writing Festival at Calvin. I don’t have much time to talk, because the next thing is starting in like 5 minutes, but I wanted to let you know I might be able to slip away to hear you talk at Cornerstone.”
I ordered the medium size print in "blues".
I'm so happy with these! I grabbed a friend and braved the yard sales this morning even though it was so hot oh my god why, but it totally paid off. I love the little set of '50s storybooks and the '40s stacking toy, and the weird little bird thing that makes a jingle-jingle sound and wobbles.
If your firm preaches an open door policy, please ensure that your team knows it’s for real and that you get the best out of it by listening to people and their experience of working on the front line, and the real time problems that prop up from time to time. No one can help get inputs from your internal and external customers better than the ones from your team who are engaging with them on a day-to-day basis.

I will later rock in an old chair in the rain, on the squeaky wooden porch, with a fragrant cup of coffee in my hand, and watch tiny geysers spring onto my lap. I will turn my face upward into the rain for the cleansing of my sorrows and fears. I will wander aimlessly through the hazelnut orchard, tugging and releasing wet branches over my head. I will baptize myself until I feel young again.

I was reminded this evening, although I didn’t actually need reminding, that it’s been 17 sad years since we lost a beautiful lady in our lives, a wonderful auntie who never had her own children yet lived every niece and nephew as if they were her own, treated them, laughed with them, taught them and disciplined them.
In honour of dear friends moving away and inspired by our recent holiday in France, this dish was the first course of a four course French themed feast for the occasion.

I didn't feel going on a late honeymoon was a justifyable enough reason to venture onto an aircraft and I was appalled at myself for being talked into clicking the little green button on the site labelled "Book Flights" but Paul had insisted and there was nothing I would not do for my husband. Ever since I had though, an incredible sense of forboding had begun to grow in my body and I even wandered once or twice if I should cancel it. I did not disclose my misgivings and my inward battle, they would not have been recognised anyhow.

It's hard to single out anything in particular, he was just on and connected with the crowd well. Did his normal one-liners while playing piano and his "characters", a few I hadn't seen before.
Soon it is time to ready the babies for the walk to the gate(s). Sr. Ellen has to get special passes for us, as only ticketed people can go to the gates. Going through security is quite an ordeal--we have to put OUR shoes, purses and bags through ... fold up the stroller and put it and baby's bag through while holding the baby! After passing the security check, we get everyone settled in the correct stroller with the right bag and are off to the correct gate! The 9-11 surely has made things more difficult for us at SFO.

We could use the cash a garage sale, or craigslist/ebay whatever would merit, but with a barely working camera and the major headache of a garage sale and a husband who works most Saturdays lately and a broken down truck in the driveway.... I don't know if it's even worth it. I did sale some furniture already, (though I deeply regret selling this chair)... but I really need new couches (and to repair that dang truck) and so the money, even if not much sounds great. So, I know it will either be a garage sale, or I am calling up a charity to come and haul off tons and tons of boxes and can only hope that we could get a decent tax write off.
Jack Holloway is a likable character from the start. Although he is definitely a jerk, he’s a pretty funny jerk and it is clear early on that, despite his flaws, he actually isn’t that bad of a guy. He is an accomplished lawyer who was unfortuantely disbarred because of an incident that had nothing to do with his knowledge of the law, and he generally seems like the sort of guy who is a good man, but who definitely believes that the ends justify the means. The supporting cast are all strong, but Holloway is a pretty much perfectly developed character. Scalzi’s sense of humor is reflected clearly in Holloway’s demanor, and it suits the character perfectly.

The flakes are really gorgeous and the colors in them range from gold and green and pink to blue and purple (click on the photo below to enlarge it so you can see the flakes better...they're so pretty!); it's original name really suits the color. I'm going to love layering this over lots of different polishes, it's such a fun addition.
That experience was one of the most important and formative of my teenage years. It really set me up for returning to the UK and almost straight away moving to St Andrews to begin my first year at university. It gave me such person confidence, and let me see the world in a new way. It let me dream dreams larger than my world view as a quiet Scottish lad growing up in Selkirk in the Scottish Borders.

In a world that seems to be run by the major corporations, the stories where a lone hero takes on a megalithic corporation, brings down the owner of the company, and saves the world just are not plausible. Though I’m sure the presidents of the major corporations think they are indispensable, they are not. If they are eliminated, there will always be others to take their place, and the corporations will go on doing whatever it is that they do.
Anyway, I am on the other side of the process right now, interviewing interns to come and work here this summer. It's amazing what the perspective gives you. Sometimes, I think back to what I would have been like, I wonder how I was hired! Haha.

Being across the pond this is all sort of a mute point now, there are no Targets here. I got to see what friends bought at the Jason Wu collab. and while everything was very nice I wasn’t too jealous as the same high-necked sun dresses and structured hand-bags are for sale at Primark. Everything is first lady suitable and Michelle Obama has set the new standard for work appropriate chic wearing a lot of Jason Wu’s creations. His mix of blues and whites is amazing as always and the trench coats are gorgeous (although I do have a very similar one from Brooklyn industries). Then I look at his Spring 2012 line and it’s just so amazing I can’t even speak. There are 100 ways to incorporate that kind of grace and shine into the mainstream collection so why is Target styling us down?
All the stamping is stamped off once first, to get a more soft look. The main sentiment panel image is one of the new stamps from the Apothecary set - I inked up the outline of one, and then die-cut it!
That way the math will always come out right.
I wouldn't let my kids watch "The Wizard of Oz" for years. And of course when they did they thought it was perfectly ridiculous and weren't scared at all. The Disney movies they had seen by then dealt with far scarier themes than monkeys with wings. Their culture is different from the one I grew up in, and I'm not talking about the unschooling culture here. The world is different than it was when I was growing up.

Battling an addiction to alcohol or drugs often has a negative impact on the alcoholic/addict’s close relationships.

With that said, it's been a busy time in the Dziekan household these last couple of weeks. Hubby is home for a few and what does that mean?!? Major Honey Do lists. Living a military family life means we do things a bit differently than most families around here. I spend the majority of my days as a "single momma" raising the brood on my own counting down the days until Daddy returns. When he does, we do glamorous things like get work done on Momma's car (can't have something happen when he is away), work on other Daddy only jobs, like feverishly building Pinewood Derby cars, and plan and execute much postponed birthday parties. Once all of that is done, we say our goodbyes, and then then hold on with both hands until he makes it back one more time. Only to do it all over again in another few weeks. Oh yea, this wife of a Naval Aviator stuff is oh. so. glamorous. not.
Mitzi Szereto’s controversial new take on Jane Austen’s classic focuses on what goes on beneath the women’s skirts and behind the men’s breech flaps. Moreover, Pride & Prejudice: Hidden Lusts includes a range of erotic encounters spanning from homosexual indulgences and sado-masichistic desires to masturbation and oral sex.
And I have been busy AND in avoidance mode. I'm just not in the mood to deal with much of anything. But... I do have good news -
When the sun lit the room, I finally remembered the phone, my heart sinking. I picked it up, hoping that I had been asleep and just dreamt that part. I don’t know what proof I was expecting to find. Deleted texts? But what I did find made me nearly cry in relief.

I’ve gone on at length here about my feelings regarding Dogfish Head’s brews. For my previous posts about DFH Brewing go HERE. I’ve tried one of their raisin concoctions, a peach disaster, an IPA, a chicory stout, an Indian brown ale and their pumpkin beer. I like the chicory, the brown ale and the pumpkin beer, which puts them at a 50% success rate in my book. (No reason to give up on someone at 50%, hell if that was the case Mrs. BeerRant would have left me years ago!) Bottom line: I like enough of their beers to continue trying them simply on their record alone, but factor in the personality behind the brewery and I’m always willing to give them a shot. So far, the series Brew Masters is at 100 percent.

If you were to poke around the internet, looking at bits and pieces of the work that I’ve created over the years, (and heck, the ambiance of this blog!) you may have noticed that I enjoy interpreting and re-interpreting my favorite nature-companions: Trees!
This year, little rain. Weeds have already taken over AND gone to seed.
Every year I did a little more than the year before.My first 5 years I probably earned between $100 – $2,000 a year from acting.Year 6 brought me some of my biggest success and I only made $8,000 from acting.But, I put a lot more money into my career than that. Headshots are expensive. The photo session and getting prints can run anywhere from $500-$800. Classes range from $150-500 a month. It costs $1,200 to join SAG once you are eligible.And apartments are crazy expensive.$700 – $1,000 for a crappy apartment that you share with at least one roommate.Its no wonder my living room curtain was a bed sheet.

In response, angry MPs accused the police management of lying to them during previous meetings.
So it’s more about history for many, about being an expert in how things were, and a perspective on how we are. It’s also about wearing neat clothes and living life as someone else for a while. And about adding your personality to that character, reacting to your surroundings as that person might have, as the two ladies on the swings did—had they been dressed like that and walking through a park and seen the swings, of course they would have hopped on and gone for a ride.

FIR & Chargesheet:
I've been trying to eat a healthy and balanced breakfast full of protein and a little fat. In all the research I've read, this seems to be a good idea for somebody who is like me--IE--someone who needs something fast that tastes good because they don't have much of a chance to eat throughout the day because they are so busy taking care of tiny people they hardly have a minute for eating something balanced and nutritious!
The Social Club would be non-profit but would require a small donation from any members using the minibus to donate to the 'maintenance fund' to keep the minibus in tip-top condition etc. Because the minibus would be insured for any driver over 25, we can see no reason why any member cannot take the minibus themselves without us if they so want. Obviously we'd have to 'know' these members.
While some may ‘misuse’ it, there are many young people who use it to pay for their lunches at school. Without this vital support from the Government, many teenagers would be told by their parents that they can’t stay in school. The SNP’s protection of the EMA is a very strong support for young people.

In his declaration, however, he did not give any details on those “mistakes” that are, concretely: 33 civilians murdered, 225 tortured civilians, 20 victims of rape (17 women and three men), and three forced disappearances between December of 2006 and December of 2011. The latter information is contained in 82 archives from the National Commission on Human Rights. In addition, amongst these “mistakes” from the Army are those linked to the murder of five children, the torture of 10 children, the raping of two youngsters and sexual abuses against other two.
He married Zora Lyman, a fiddle player who performed and recorded with him. Eventually, Luther shifted his focus to children's songs, enjoying considerable success with his recordings on which he sang and told stories.

At the first sign of decent weather (yes, we have had a little) Hubby and youngest son sprang into action and fenced off the bottom third of the garden: The chix were confined to barracks. We’re lucky enough to have a fairly big garden, so the chix get to free range to their hearts’ content, within limits. A few days’ power-washing and the patio is as good as new. A bit of tidying around the flower beds, wood chip applied and the garden’s looking fit again. Oh, and the heucheras have survived and are growing fast: The chicken poo has compensated the garden for the ravaging.

What were you even thinking, crawling along my car stereo with your big long hairy legs, heading for the steering wheel where my poor frightened hands were clenched as I attempted to drive? Huh? HUH? Didn't you know I'd scream like a banshee and swerve toward oncoming traffic? Didn't you know I'd holler at the Kris Face, who just happened to be in the passenger seat, to smash you to smithereens? Too bad he had to do it with his bare hand...ewww! Welp, now you're looking all dead. Ha!

Further, the Planning Commission’s approach paper to the twelfth five year plan makes it clear that there is no scope for a rise in public funding of higher education and the government is looking at the private sector as the engine growth in the higher education sector. The approach paper says: “Resource constraints will make it difficult to meet the need of expanding higher education entirely through the public sector. Not all private educational institutions are of good quality and some are quite inferior. Minimum standards will have to be ensured. But free entry will, in the end, automatically weed out the poor quality institutions. Private initiatives in higher education, including viable and innovative PPP-models, will therefore, be actively promoted. The current “not-for-profit” prescription in the education sector should be re-examined in a pragmatic manner…”

“The swastika has morphed into a universal symbol of hate,” said Abraham Foxman, the national director of the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish advocacy organization. “Today it’s used as an epithet against African-Americans, Hispanics and gays, as well as Jews, because it is a symbol which frightens.”

The Bata Shoe Museum in Toronto presents Roger Vivier: Process to Perfection beginning May 10, 2012. In this exhibition, the work of Roger Vivier, one of the 20th century's most important shoemakers, will be displayed for the first time in North America. Loans from museums around the world, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, have been obtained to create a full picture of the work of this master shoemaker. I will be attending the opening party for this event on May 8th.
OK, today I was able to get 4 LeapFrog Tag books for $6.99. They are buy 1 get 1 free at Target this week but you better hurry because they were already selling out by the time I got there at 11:30am. I also had 2 $5 coupons for the Tag books. I posted last week how to get those coupons. Finally I had a $3 coupon sent to me from Leapfrog.
For the last several years, I’ve been using a new approach to Bible Reading. On Mondays I read from the Law (Genesis through Deuteronomy), on Tuesdays I read through the History (Joshua through Job). On Wednesdays I read the Wisdom books (Psalms through Song of Solomon). On Thursdays I read through the Prophets (Isaiah through Malachi). On Fridays I read through the Gospels and Acts (Matthew through Acts of the Apostles), and on Saturdays I read from the Epistles to the end of the New Testament (Romans through Revelation). On Sundays I read Scripture that is pertinent to the sermon that I’m preaching that day. I really like using this concept because I’m able to glean from every section of the Bible each and every week.

CONCLUSION: A decent party / rival fraternity college movie. It doesn’t get hunkered down by the romance, and keeps the comedy central to the plot. Slightly better than American Pie 5: The Naked Mile. We shall be progressing to American Pie 7 before too long.
Panini just released some images and details for its 2011 Playoff Contenders Patches product scheduled to be released sometime in February. I haven't been a big fan of the Contenders line in the past (aside from last year's Season Tickets set), and I don't think I'm going to be a fan of this year's either. It's not that 2011 Contenders is a bad product. Actually, I think this is going to be a very nice product with value for collectors. I'll get into the negatives later, but here are some of the good aspect Contenders offers.

Vyst could feel his fingers now, and soon his toes. The gods had paralysed him when he and his minions had first broke out of their domain in Vesuvius. They had planned to overthrow the gods and over take the world. They captured the city of Pompeii before the gods could stop them and buried the whole city in ash before giving themselves up. Now that Vyst was beginning to regain his powers he could plan to take revenge on the gods. From one of his hypnotised minions he found out that a son, the heir to his kingdom had been born to Jupiter. Vyst had puzzled out how to take revenge on the gods, yet he still needed to draw a proper battle plan.

According to the blurb in the book The Draft House opened back in 2009, it is one of a small chain of three bars. It is a small place, if you know the Harp in Charing Cross then think along those lines but without the upstairs part. Luckily we arrived early enough on Saturday evening to bag a table in the window and after adjusting the curtain so cut out the cold December wind when the door opened it was a snug warm seat.
I know it may be hard to believe but there is a silver lining in all of this news. The former members of GSC have already gone ahead and created a new development studio called Vostok Games and are hard at work on their next project. They were unable to reach an agreement with the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. brand rights holder so the gang at Vostok forged ahead without it.
On Sept. 28, 1896, the day after the elephant burnt down, the Brooklyn Eagle published a eulogy of sorts for the prominent pachyderm, “Loss of an Old Friend.” The writer, using delicate language, suggested the elephant did not always attract the most esteemed clientele.

I had a friend of mine, another designer, tell me just the other day that a client of hers had found my kitchen on the internet and wanted her to reproduce it. My friend said, "I've been in this kitchen!" Her client had no idea that the kitchen was in her own city...she just saw it online and liked it. My friend put her own spin on it, but it was very nice to hear that people enjoy the design!

I can understand what my nephews are saying and even what my patients at work (who have speech troubles) are trying to tell me because I have taken the time to learn their voice. If I had not been patient and sat with them and listened to what they were saying I would have never learned how to hear them. It is the same with God. I need to sit down day by day and take the time to get to know him so I understand the sound of his voice, so I can learn to hear his whisper.

I have a broad interest in what I consider literature for the masses — story papers, magazines, paperback originals. For years these areas were like a newly discovered country with only a handful of us traipsing around wondering what we would find. Twenty or so years ago, there was a growth in academic interest in what was dubbed "trash aesthetics". I was rather pleased to see that my books and articles were often cited, not because I had a desire to see my name in print (I've seen it so often it doesn't fill me with quite so much excitement these days) but because it means someone has read something I've written and found something of interest in it.
We're also pretty sure that he has eczema. He has eczema patches on his right arm, behind his knees and his back, they look and act like Claudy's eczema which makes me so sad and it's a constant battle to keep him lubed.
Two hours later, I was kicking myself. Two additional hours later, I was celebrating. I loved it and it was worth every last moment. I LOVE this rug. Two coats of Polycrylic sealer to finish things off, an overnight drying time and BAM, furniture on it in the morning. I couldn't wait.

“You still have your chequebook, don’t you?” I replied, and for the first time that night I saw a smile break out on Mr Pricklewood’s face. I then heard the van pull up on the drive. “I’ll be leaving you now, Pricklewood,” I said. “I suggest you take a sleeping pill, otherwise you might find it difficult to get a good night’s sleep.” I walked over to the door and remembered one more thing. “Oh and Pricklewood, give Duckworth a generous tip in the morning. He’s had quite an eventful evening.”

The arrival of Dylan Childress into her life changes that. A former child star, Dylan faded out of the limelight many years ago and has since been living in Montana, running a charter plane company. Taking a bit of a break and using it as an opportunity to investigate business practices in a down turned economy, he finds himself sticking around in Virgin River a lot longer than he originally planned. There’s some fireworks happening between Katie and him and he can’t bring himself to leave yet.

Then it’s back into the brewing hall where Scott fills our glasses with Williams Red straight from the conditioning tank. It’s a straightforward, quaffable beer that gets an extra bounce from being super fresh and lively. We sup jug after jug of it while Scott explains his use of the Golden Ratio to devise malt bills (working out exact recipes for all the Williams beers on the basis of this knowledge is left as an exercise for the reader).
My favorite is that middle-aged dude standing next to a lake with a rope swing, who says “I sure did make some foolish decisions as a teenager, swinging out over those rocks…” He then goes on to sell us the latest and greatest pharmaceutical. I, however, somehow made it past my teenage years continuing to making foolish decisions jumping over rocks.And this is exactly how I discovered the key. Well, not exactly. I figured out my problem while reminiscing on the Amway business I poured my entire college experience into and failed at. All because I was convinced that happiness was found in having all the time and money one could ever want. It sucked the life out of me: I put 25,000 miles on my car in 2006, and the stress of complete failure/intense overwork is a major factor in what I believe contributed to my cancer development.*
Hmmm, clearly you haven't done much country living! Oh, you read a book once...did you now? Now where was I going with that thought? Hmmm, errr, nope it's gone... completely vanished into the ether... you know, the ether? of, oh, whatever the ether does... I don't have time to explain everything, I mean really! This is just a blog - not some world class novel! OK, so back to my story... as you know, or perhaps not, Mossberry Cottage is an old New England barn that was converted to cozy living quarters

Now I can concentrate my efforts on the part of being an Astronaut Farmer that always intrigued me the most: gardening … Well, vegetable gardening in zero G is what really intrigued me. (Remember that scene from Lost in Space with the crazy space garden?) But since that isn’t possible here on Earth I guess experimenting with hydroponics and trellising will have to do.
The contracted carrots from the Rio Grande Valley farm are loaded in bulk onto a refrigerated truck maintained at 35 degrees and shut with a bolt seal to protect the integrity of the load. The load is shipped to Paris and then quickly unloaded at the plant. A devise called the “sputnik” crawls into the truck with a conveyor belt that gently pulls in vegetables from the lower part of the truck opening and delivers them to a second conveyor belt to be washed, sorted, and diced.
As you probably saw from the picture above, my style while camping is very relaxed but still fun! (If you hop over to my blog, you'll see that I try to make all my outfits fun whenever possible, even at work :) But the key while camping is bring lots of layers... during the day, it could be really hot, but at night the ocean winds cool the island down fast. Here I'm soaking in the sunset right before we cooked dinner, and it was already a lot cooler than earlier that day:

You'll notice that I did NOT provide a photo of the garden itself; until this afternoon, it was overrun with weeds, and the basil is so big it flopped over onto one of the pepper plants, and the tomatoes really overwhelmed the bamboo sticks that I tried in place of cages this year (good info. for next year). So it looks like hell, definitely not worthy of a photo. But it's still bringing me happiness--especially when I eat the teeny "sweet 100" tomatoes, which are really quite good.
With the need to learn more, I purchased a book, "Understanding the Tragedy of the Cathars" which I can't wait to start reading.
I hadn’t even posted there in more than six months, and have been only tangentially involved for the last two or three years. I had lost my passion for it sometime in there and it just took me this long to realize it. And, like most things in life, it’s only now that it’s gone that I truly miss it.
As far as I'm concerned, they didn't really do it for a flag or a King; they did it so that I and my children would never know the fear of waiting for the midnight knock; never have to show deference or respect to those who imposed themselves on us by force; never have to know the pain of carrying the truth in our heart but being afraid, on pain of legal sanctions or even death, to express it.
If you’d rather go out for your pizza fix, here are some options.
We've seen a lot from the more right-leaning economists over the last few years about how asset prices increases are inflation, because increases in the price of assets represent increases in the price of future consumption. I've been thinking about this, and I think they've got it backwards.

Crown Deli, at 4909 13th Avenue, was run by Rivka Rabashkin, wife of family patriarch Aaron. Founded in 1960, it had a reputation not as a going concern, but as a sort of soup kitchen, with Rivka feeding for free anybody who was hungry. But it was close several times for health violations in recent years. I can not discover what ultimately did the place in, but have to imagine it was the culmination of the family's many troubles.
I do praise the person who build this Craigslist extension for putting time and effort in making its experience so much better. Someone with a passion put time and money into it to make it better, and shared that with the world. Nothing else than praise for this person.

Why Africa you may ask? Well, I was hoping to do my Master's internship in Africa, but that didn't work out. I've been studying International Development and Non-profit management for 2 years. I didn't feel it would be right to do all that studying and reading, but never experience the true places. I'm also really lucky to have a friend, Brittni who is doing Peace Corps in Malawi. I'll be visiting her and traveling around for 5 weeks.

Rum and coke was my spirit tipple of choice as an underage drinker, almost certainly because it tastes like plain Coke with a little funny aftertaste – ideal for my underdeveloped taste buds. Now that I’m slightly more grown-up and actually enjoy the taste of nice alcohol, I can’t break the association between the taste of Cuba Libre and the escapades of my younger self, including but not limited to: getting thrown out of a bar when I left my wallet (including both fake ID and real ID) in the toilets; dry-humping in the dorm lounge at 3am; getting into a bitter fight with my roommate over some aspect of “Beauty and the Beast” I don’t even remember.

Fox News in the US, meanwhile, continues to lose viewers. His manically Rightist views (so incessantly pumped out, the Channel was voted Most Biased News Station in the US last month) are not in vogue at the moment: we could argue all day and night about exactly why, but the bottom line is that Fox’s ratings declined again last quarter (Apr-June) by 6% – and significantly, 14% in the 25-54 demographic. Newscorp’s other problem here was (until recently) Glenn ‘Bonkers’ Beck, a presenter so clearly off his head, Murdoch eventually had to dump him because corporate America stopped buying airtime in his slots. But the guy did have an audience, and it hasn’t been replaced.

Anyway, it feels good to have some needed items in our home and REAL FOOD! Our apartment is nice and I really can't complain much about it... we have a pretty great set up! I can't wait until our box of stuff and my computer arrive on Friday so we can feel a little more at home. I am NOT looking forward to turning in our car today. I am not a fan of relying on buses and taxi's to get us around, especially with two little girls and a huge stroller (which I love, but still it is heavy!). So we'll see how it all goes. I'm feeling MUCH better about this move now that I have gotten some sleep. Before I was feeling super overwhelmed with everything going on, little sleep, and realizing that we are not in suburbia anymore. Downtown city life is MUCH different! So here is to a new adventure for the next 12 weeks while Nate completes his internship. We really feel so blessed to be here!
Sings of walking,
Don't forget Christmas and the office parties are coming soon.
This week has been a wash. No way around it. I have not counted one point nor have I cared.

Yet I succumb to the powers of ice cream and burritos.

Because nothing says you’re filling a necessary void like an excruciatingly detailed exposition of your journey with psychotropic medications, therefore a blogger is beholden to describe her course in its entirety, stops and starts, gains and losses, why I changed my mind, then changed my mind again, til I came upon the final wisdom, whether from compliance to non-compliance or non-compliance to compliance and the road back to where I was before the meds destroyed my fill-in-the-blank, the fact of the matter is every veil that falls from my eyes will be validated by matching veils falling from your own.

Now on to my argument: accessible post-secondary education provides both individual and collective benefits. If an individual invests wisely in post-secondary studies she is likely to find higher paying work upon graduation and will earn more over the course of her career. On a collective level we as a society benefit from having more people graduate from universities because it makes us smarter, innovative, and more competitive. As such, it is to our benefit to have well-funded world class universities which act as engines of economic growth.
Because that is the underlying rule, expectations of behavior in this God-breathed place are surely different than in the places ruled by contract. The practice of loving God and others must be learned slowly, much as an artist or musician learns their skills. First, we master the basics, and then once those basics are thoroughly integrated, glorious creativity has room to flourish.
Right now we’re going to hold it all together as best we can, by the grace of God. God has given us a platform, a footing with university students that we cannot relinquish. It’s been a gift of God that somehow we have had the favor to gather people and propel them out for God’s kingdom agenda around the world. Passion 2010 will be back in Atlanta. We’re expecting somewhere between 20,000 and 25,000 university students here from around the world.

I lost my mother during the year. In fact, it will be a year this month. I can't believe how much harder it is a year later than even in the beginning. I wish I had held her hand more, had her over to the house more, sat down after a full day of shopping to have that cup of tea she always offered. I miss her.
Anyway, enough of that…! We chatted to other pilots and pored over maps before parting with £5 as we hopped on the chairlift up the hill. Wow, this is civilised!
The Case of the Overprotective Ass: Stars of the silver screen Alasdair Hamilton and Toby Bowe are wowing the post WWII audiences with their depictions of Holmes and Watson. When they are asked by a friend to investigate a mysterious disappearance, they jump at the chance—surely detection can’t be that hard? But a series of threatening letters—and an unwanted suitor—make real life very different from the movies.

As part of GiRL FeST San Diego, a lecture and panel discussion was hosted at San Diego State Friday titled “War on Women: Human Trafficking in the U.S.” GiRL FeST is a nonprofit festival with the purpose of “changing peer culture in order to prevent increasing violence against women and girls through education, art and positive representations of women.”

“You’ll never lose them. Let me explain. You probably don’t realize you’re in the middle. Being in the middle is when you died but you didn’t leave. You stayed here, but I know you already know that.”
A lot of feelings. You always called it misery and you said that I became miserable since you left. Loneliness. Emptiness. Confusion. Anger. Self-pity. And many others that I may have forgotten along the way. Forgotten… Yet a simple joke, a song, a TV show or what-have-you can be like a huge force that destroys a dam that keeps the flood of memories from freely flowing.

The class ran for about an hour and a half and I have to say that there was a lot of info jammed into that session. We were giving a duo-tang with a lot of helpful handouts about almost everything you could think of during your pregnancy, and the good part is these classes and everything you are given are free. The public health nurse who was teaching the class was very informative and helpful, answering any questions that were asked. There are 3 more classes left and they are held every Tuesday from 7-9pm.
When I begin to realize that I've been mistaken for furniture it's a tough call to know when to call it a night. If you wait around the crowd thins out but there's no guarantee that anyone will come over and ask you to dance (or return a well thrown cabecco).

The beer poured a very clean and clear pale yellow with a large white head. The carbonation was easily seen as many tiny bubbles rose up through the glass. The head left thick lacing on the side of the glass. Lemon and citrus aromas were the most prevalent but also a dry and yeasty element were noticeable as well. Despite being dry hopped (with US grown hops) the aroma was not as intense as I would have thought (not necessarily a bad thing). The beer was also fermented with a tradition Belgian yeast which is where the style originated.

Eric was busy shuffling between our home which was about 40 minutes away with our then 21 month old and the hospital where we were. We wanted Conner to have as normal a life as possible after the new baby came. I know Eric was torn between being with me and taking Conner home to be with him. We both decided he would take him home and come back the next morning. Eric left me with a hug and a kiss. We wanted Conner to be able to sleep in his own bed as much as possible. After he picked him up, my mom came to the hospital to be with me. I remember my her walking into my room. I started crying as we were packing up my things.
It’s hard to fathom that kind of anti-Indian feeling so soon after 1971. But from all accounts, anti-Indian feeling was a strong part of Bangladeshi politics a generation ago. Taher motivated his jawans by claiming that Khaled was an Indian puppet. And six years later, after killing Zia, Manzur declared the 25-year treaty of friendship with India null and void.

When news broke that the Petrino passenger (Jessica Dorrell) had been promoted to work in the football office just a week or so before the accident that set this mess in motion, it was clear that Petrino had likely sealed his fate with the Razorbacks. Say what you want about “morality clauses” (the mere idea of which in big time sports at any level amuse me a little bit), but Human Resources rules trump all, and at that point Petrino ran afoul of every Human Resources rule put in place since the Clarence Thomas hearings.

A mother with a child in the army, in a combat unit, in danger, is even more frantic – if she has the courage to even attend and listen. You know you should be thinking about them...but really, so much of the time your thoughts turn to your own. I didn’t have the courage the first year. I can say that now and feel a bit of shame.I couldn’t. I'm not sure I went the second year either. I think it was only the third year, after Elie had been in the war...and he was with me, that I was able to go. And even then, my thoughts were on Elie. “Please, God – keep him safe. Thank you. Thank you for watching over him. Please keep him safe.”
She sent me a picture of a couple rustic looking hooks she liked and I plan to try and mimic them, but I’d also like to make a few with some personal flair; just see what she likes. I haven’t really made a lot of these sort of things because knives, axes and the like have just always drawn my attention. Something about growing up a fantasy geek. But as I’ve explored the world of metal work more and more over the past few years I’ve grown to have a real appreciation for decorative ironwork. I’m glad to have a reason to make something.

I love in Calgary , Ab and when Falls starts here it's kind of depressing. Depressing because I know that for a few weeks the trees will look radiant, then they'll lose their leaves and the cold and snow will start. I'm a Northern California girl, born and raised. Five to six months of winter is not something I'll EVER get used to. Yes I've lived here for eleven and a half years, but I still miss having a real Fall. A Fall that lasts for a couple months, not a couple weeks. This time of year always has me missing home.
Taking care of Polly has brought me into direct and immediate contact with the mysterious world of women. While I thought I was ready for this, it turns out that, much like in rock climbing, there is a distinct difference between visualizing a route and executing the climb. From the ground it can be relatively easy to pick out the series of points one wants to hit, but up on the cliff, getting through those points is never that simple. With each move upward, new details emerge and new options appear, creating questions that challenge and complicate the previously established choices.
Lastly, DO REMEMBER TO SUPPORT INDEPENDENT BOOKSHOPS! The bookselling industry is changing rapidly at the moment with the expansion of ebook publishing and online book buying. I’m guilty of it too – I live in the Italian countryside and I love receiving my used Amazon books and I have a 10kg luggage limit with Ryan air, so I won’t be bringing many books home with me. But if you’re here tonight you’re probably a book lover anyway so do continue to savour independent bookshops. Hang out in them, order your copies from them. Go inside and order my book! Thank you I’ll now read two short excerpts and then I’ll ask any questions you may have.
I always get a little down just after Christmas. Nothing to serious mind, its not like I’m going to suddenly hang myself with sparkly tinsel or anything. I think its more a combination of having a solid two months of literally everything screaming at you “Its Christmas!” and then the day being over quicker than the space between two heartbeats. Its bound to leave you a bit blue, and all those decorations and lights always serve to remind you that its all over and there are no more presents to unwrap. Which sucks.

In addition, UK car emissions are dropping: just over 4% in 2011 against 2010 and nearly 31% comparing to 1997. To hit the EU target - cars must have emissions less than 130g/km by the end of 2012 and 95g/km by 2020. In England we trust.
"You girls today have so many choices. In my day you got married or maybe if you were real brave you taught school or became a nurse.

The other day I was spending some time with my 2 year old niece. We were driving home from the mall, chatting about random things. One of the things she said was, “I told someone at the mall that I weigh 30 pounds. What’s your number?” Of course, coming from a 2 year old, it’s a totally innocent question and means nothing. But it made me sad for a minute, because I know that in less than 10 years there is a very very good chance that she will be obsessed with, and believe that she’s defined by, all of her “numbers.” Weight. Size. Inches. Pounds. Calories. Grams. I wish for her that a massive miracle happens and that somehow she finds her way through all of that without losing herself in it.

Within Desteni there is a saying – Knowledge without application is useless – and that is very true when I look at myself where I gathered extensive knowledge about the functionality of the system and humanity but I did not apply this knowledge in real life – I wasn’t even writing it out where I could actually internalize that knowledge and make it clear for myself where I put all this knowledge in my own words as a statement of actual understanding and where from there I would change and live that knowledge as myself testing it in the real physical world seeing whether it works or not. Instead I accumulated knowledge from different books and articles and eventually I got lost in it not being able to actually be clear on any point or issue because this knowledge wasn’t mine but borrowed.

Now, most of the apes I know would consider giving sex lessons to be like teaching someone how to scratch an itch. Certainly, any human who offered gorillas mating advice would be hooted out of the jungle with his underpants pulled over his head. As an ape who prides himself on being a student of humanity, I have pondered the question of why humans, of all the primates, have to be taught how to do it. I believe the answer can be summed up in three words: the human female.

To show their usefulness, at least in the case of S.U.C.C.E.S.S., the article provides the example of a Japanese immigrant who was unable to find work in Vancouver so S.U.C.C.E.S.S. helped her open a flower shop. But if she was unable to find work then why is she in Canada if there are no jobs for her here? How is her opening a flower shop beneficial to Canadians? How many jobs does that create and how many are well paying? How does it improve our standard of living? It contributes to economic activity but so does a crime wave. In any case economic activity does not equate quality of life.

As I need structure in my life in order to be happy, I have created this rough scheduling system where I set four simple goals I will accomplish each day.

I have included a screenshot of my day plan (not showing the parts that have other people’s names on it for privacy reasons).

These monopolies control their markets killing off the competition by getting corporate welfare from their friends in government. They destroy our environment as did British Petroleum, and The Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf-of-Mexico in April of 2010. They spilled 100s of millions of barrels of petroleum into the Gulf killing wild life, destroying the health of 10s of thousands of people, closing down 100s of local businesses, and contaminating the land for 87 consecutive days. It’s still contaminated two years later with blooms of petroleum floats around in the ocean. It’s going to take hundreds of years for the Gulf to clear up from these toxic waters filled with oil. There were 225,000 claims file against BP, and The Deepwater Horizon and they settled for 7.8 billion in this law suit, or about 27,000 per claim this was an abuse of political power. http://globalwarming.house.gov/spillcam
Here is a little description about this piece and my current body of work: I incorporate college materials I collect from recycled magazines, newspapers, and old books. I then dissolve the printed color pigment with a special solvent and turn the printed material into what appears to be dreamy watercolor studies. In turn, I rip those images apart and start assembling a “skeleton” of sorts on the canvas. I think in terms of color and texture. I break down and then build back up; erase, yet reveal. I use numerous layers of paint, washes, glazes, medium, spliced text, handmade paper, tissue, and gesture marks to make the piece appear to be a unified surface; My intention is to create layers of information through my technique; leading your mind’s eye on an aesthetic journey. It is a form of communication, and contradiction.

Moses took the bones of Joseph with him because Joseph had made the Israelites swear an oath. He had said, “God will surely come to your aid, and then you must carry my bones up with you from this place.” (Exodus 13:19)Joseph traveled more after his death than he ever had while he was alive. His bones were carried as the Israelites traveled to the foot of Mt. Sinai. His bones went with them as they came to banks of Jordan. His bones turned back and wandered with them through the wilderness for 40 years. And after the death of Moses, the bones of Joseph were carried into Canaan and accompanied the Israelites on the conquest of the land. Finally, after the death of Joshua, the bones of Joseph were laid to rest "beneath the green, green grass of home."

That's a glimpse of the living room in the photo above. It's a Victorian on a pretty, tree-lined street in one of my favorite neighborhoods. It's near coffee shops, restaurants, and nature trails, it has a large old barn out back and, while the yard is on the small side, there's plenty of room for gardening.

In Mein Kampf, Hitler expressed great admiration for Mussolini and did in the early days regard Mussolini as his teacher so at least part of Hitler's National Socialism is traceable to Mussolini's innovations. As noted, however, Mussolini did NOT reciprocate Hitler's regard and correctly divined and loathed Hitler's murderous personality from the beginning (Andriola, 1997). Hitler's mania about the Jews was also one reason why Mussolini derided Nazism as a doctrine of barbarians. Few modern-day Leftists would argue with that judgement.

Child marriages are a worldwide phenomenon, particularly in rural areas with high poverty rates and closely-guarded ancient traditions. In parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, The Middle East and even the U.S. underage children are forced into marriages at the behest of their families. In recent years, American officials have cracked down on fundamentalist polygamist sects in Utah and Texasknown to pair adult grooms with child brides. Other countries provide less legal clout needed to protect young girls. In Yemen where, there is no punishment for families who marry off an underage daughter, about half the country’s brides are under 15. In Saudi Arabia, there is no minimum age for marriage at all. An 8-year old girl found this out in 2009, when the Saudi courts denied her annulment request. At the time, her husband was 58.
This might be the case of the FBI actually catching some criminals in the process of doing something violent, but it seems to resemble other cases of “stings” that are little more than Government arrest of politically unpopular and marginalized speakers.

Here, you need Wonderbread. Yup, I said it. Wonderbread. This is not a platform for good sourdough or chewy baguette. I like Wonderbread (the wonder is at the ingredient list and remarkable, consequent, pillowy softness) and I will eat it once or twice a year in an emergency. Toasted cheese on the braai is the response to an emergency of homesickness. It is like taking a pill to stop the jitters. I imagine.

But this festival is different than many music festivals for a few reasons and again, that is why the hosts have decided to allow a public gathering on their sacred land:
Toubab Krewe will donate one dollar from every CARNAVALITO ticket purchased to Instruments for Africa, a not-for-profit organization that aims to empower underprivileged and at-risk youth in Mali through the preservation of traditional music and arts. Toubab Krewe and Instruments for Africa have launched a campaign to build the Krewe House, a music school project set to break ground in 2013.

Night fell, and we heard the damnable wails of wild things in the distance. We were alone, nothing to shelter us and the moon loomed overhead, leaving us naked to searching eyes. I looked at Sorry and she was fearful, clutching at her baby. We didn't stop that night, but padded on into the darkness. The howling came louder to our ears until we could feel the hot breath of a circling pack. They were wary, but also they were many. Sorry was tired and finally she sat heavily to the ground. She put the baby under her legs and picked up some of the many stones that lay in the dirt. I waved my sticks into the air and yelled loudly. The baby cried, and the cretans slobbered and gibbered in the night, hoping to sink their fangs into the soft thing we protected. One of them came near, I saw it hunched wickedly on two legs, its hairy arms curled and slashing madly in my direction. I quickly lunged at it, striking it in the face and it cursed madly, falling away. They were smaller than we, and weaker. This land of no substance had made them frail, but they were starving and desperate. Sorry finally slept, exhausted, and I swung my weapons about in a circle until the moon fell away from a rising sun. The creatures slunk away into the shadows, bleeding from the many wounds I had laid upon them. She awoke as I fell, not caring any more, and Sorry gasped aloud.

Look I don’t want to bore you for too long so I’ll just suggest a couple of others for you. Over in Austria, a chap named Norbert Schneider sang this very “different” number called Medicate my blues away. It couldn’t be further away from the Trackshittaz. Norbert’s into his blues in a big way, and although this wouldn’t normally be my Tasse Tee, I rather like its smooth chirpiness. It’s the title track of his new album too. It didn’t make the superfinal in Austria – probably to his credit.

It took about a year of MathMan's taunting to get me to pronounce cement with the emphasis on the second syllable. To get me to say inSURance instead of INsurance and umBRELLa instead of UMbrella. A few years in the South have sort of undone that, but I'm able to switch back and forth pretty easily because even if I don't speak with a clean Midwestern non-accent accent, I'm aware of when my words begin to drawl out like a hot afternoon.
But right now, all I can do for those in Parliament who want to ignore these issues because Bob McCoskrie’s penis might get angry at them is remind them of this:
Ben, Gabriella and I took Nyla for a walk Wednesday evening before bed. Gabriella ran into the house and changed into cute purple and white paisley pajamas (slightly too big) and dress shoes and announced she was ready for the walk. I compromised on the pjs but suggested more sensible shoes. Ben held the leash on the first half of the walk and Gabriella on the second half. Nyla doesn't really walk on a leash yet, not in a straight line on the sidewalk as you might imagine a dog on a walk. She follows her nose into yards and then greets each of us then goes back to the sidewalk. If you aren't careful you can get all wound up in the leash. So imagine Gabriella walking saying things like "Come here girl! Good girl! I love you Nyla! You are such a good, good girl!" Every few steps she pauses, raises the arm holding the leash in the air, twirls to untangle herself and then pulls up her shorts with a swift tug at the end of each twirl. This happens about repeatedly all down the street. Such a big girl!
McDonalds has certainly come-on-board with some of their healthier options. Yet it can be hard knowing if they really are “healthy”. And if you are in the habit of ordering the same meal every time you visit, it can be difficult breaking the cycle. The triggers and temptations still remain.

Somehow the conversation turned to guides and guardian angels. I don’t remember if we were debating the existence of each or of their attributes as they existed. As I looked up from my plate to my friend opposite me I remember saying: “And your guide is a western Indian. He is a golden Indian. And he’s standing right behind your left shoulder.” I said it nonchalantly and off the cuff without thinking. That’s how it came up in the conversation.
Weddings are supposed to be all about the fun little details, right? Well, no, weddings are *supposed* to be about the commitment of two people to one another. It sure seems like that "little" fact gets lost in the To Do Lists and the party planning and the sorting out of a hundred little decisions every time I turn around, though. For the most part, planning a wedding is fun, I guess. Until it's not. Until the first time in this whole process that I completely psych myself out.

I like Green Mountain coffee and there is that too. I will look for DD and Kona for it. Anyway, I was so excited, as it will be so nice to have it when I just want a cup. I told you I had a wonderful daughter in law. The rest of the story is, they weren't supposed to do anything for me as they had just surprised me with 2 new tires and new brakes on my car. I had the two front ones replaced earlier,and there weren't many miles on them. They had been run low on air. Who would do that? Heaven help me.lol Anyway this was last week. God has blessed me with the most wonderful children.

Occasionally I bring lunch for my kids in school. I love observing the children in school especially the little ones. It is even more fun to watch the young ones at the beginning of the year. Watching them struggle with breaking a hard boiled egg shows me the independence that a child learns away from home in big school for the first time. It is quite a wonder to watch them really.

Depending on the individual schedule, you might also have more academic days than a traditional school schedule. We don’t, because we only have school Monday through Thursday, which gives us lovely 3-day weekends to enjoy, which works better for us. As long as we have a comparable number of ‘in class’ days, I figure that’s plenty (though we do log school time in our ‘off’ weeks, we just don’t do formal, sit-down work).

A side note, relating to casting: some of the themes of the film deal with the ideas of ageing and female empowerment. At one point Stone's character bemoans the fact that she had to stand down as the poster girl for her cosmetics company because she has turned 40. (Stone herself has made similar comments about the lack of decent film roles for actresses over a certain age.) Although this seems a topical reference point, the film doesn't expand on the idea. The chance to make a valid point about Hollywood's – or indeed any beauty-obsessed industry – fixation on youth and fixed-age looks isn’t taken.
The question I kept finding myself asking was: What caused Didi and Gogo to become tramps in the first place? No one is born a tramp and yet, somewhere along the line, the wanderlust takes a hold of certain people. What would cause someone to one day up and leave everything and turn into homo peripateticus, aimlessly wandering the roads? There are plenty of recorded cases of men who have, for no apparent reason, abandoned their lives and been discovered, often hundreds of miles away, living completely different lives and unaware of what they’ve done, but there are more who, to escape what’s going on at home, simply run away. Is that what happened to them?
I easily took my dry fava beans, tossed them in a small Crockpot with enough water and started it on high for about an hour. When the beans come out of the Crockpot, they should be slightly firm on the outside and soft on the inside. I like to just break one in half to assure they are done (then I pop it in my mouth- shh). A quick rinse of the cooked beans to remove gas making properties, and then I was off to make this super easy recipe. It was so easy and the finished product reminded me so much of my favorite Arabic foods. The final dish tastes a lot like a slightly less creamy Ful Madamas but with American herbs – aka Thyme. The moon sliced onions give it a slight crunch and the vegetable sauce gives it a homey creamy texture to well round the entire dish. We served the bean mixture with organic wild rice, artisan salad and a partial piece of Trader Joes Baked Tofu. Totally Perfect!

Since then the Government, with some assistance from Europe, has attempted an “Operation Stable Door”. The Irish Commissioner has been salvaged. Solemn and “legally binding” assurances or declarations on some of the other problematic issues for Ireland have been promised by our partners. The Government can point to these as evidence that Europe has come to meet us to justify putting the issue to the people again. With the economy in freefall our need for friends in Europe, which constitutes our comfort blanket, has never been greater. Whether the voters will agree remains to be seen. There is a dangerous argument gaining currency that Europe will have to bend to our wishes, that the other 26 can do nothing without us. These are Interesting Times. I would not bet the family silver on that outcome!

Universal Musik Noise was a female fronted indie band that functioned out of San Francisco in the early-mid 80’s. The band consisted of six members, who centered their attention on their vocalist leader - Lela. It looks like the enterprising Lela even had her own record label, which issued this LP in a limited fashion. The band plays with edge and carries a post punk influence throughout. At times Schizophrenia holds true to name and runs through quirky experimentation tangents with over the top vocals, but all and all - it’s what you would expect from a private press independent offering. Some above par post punk highlights – “Our Land” and “Come Sleep With Me”….More information can be found on Discogs…An intriguing set of 11 songs…Out of print via Lela’s Lovely Label, San Francisco.

This single page 12x12 layout was made using mostly papers from Echo Park's "Playground" line (plus a couple of solids from Stampin' Up). I am a HUGE Echo Park fan - their papers are wonderful to design with! I used the Cricut Essentials cartridge to cut the navy blue "merry-go-round" wheel at 9 1/2". The orange circle behind it is 10", and the white circle behind that is 10 1/4". The cut isn't really meant to be a merry-go-round, but I thought it kinda looked like one and went with the paper and theme. I also cut the arrows from Cricut Essentials, all at 3", including the white shadows.

The Rays beat the Blue Jays 5-2 on Sunday Afternoon thanks to eight strong innings by Wade Davis. Their five runs all came on the long ball: B.J. Upton and Ben Zobrist hits homers in the first inning, Evan Longoria went deep in the third, and Kelly Shoppach homered in the sixth. Combined with Boston's doubleheader split, the Rays now sit one game behind the Sox in the AL wild card race, with three games to go.

Maria stands alone on a dark sea shore. The waves are strong that night, crashing against the sand like angry strikes against the earth. In the reflection of the water Maria can see all the night sky. Each star in motion as if they found life within the waters of the sea. The moon shone through brightest of all, full and beautiful like a mother to all the sparks of light surrounding her. The beauty of the night sky always fascinated Maria. She often found herself looking up at it when the night was clear, but there was something special about nights like these when the sky was clear, the moon was full and the waves were strong.

Mediocre students found him boring. It was a different story for me. I had heard of anthropology, of course, as a kid, but my eyes were glued on science. Once I entered college, I thought I would leave behind the things that fascinated me as a kid; fossils, tales of Amazonian and Polynesian explorers, storytelling, how human bodies were put together (and taken apart), martial arts, strange plants and what can be done with them, cannibalism, archaeology, foreign languages, etc. Under Davis' tutelage, I learned that all these are exactly the sorts of things that anthropologists study. Took me a year to switch majors, but once I did, I never looked back on the biologist I might have been.
It's funny but there was a time, back in my prime, where I knew I was virtually invincible.
Manager Nigel Adkins has done a magnificent job and replicated Norwich City in achieving back to back promotions and ending up in the Premier League. Adkins has won 60 of his 98 games in charge which is remarkable and deserves to be praised and in my opinion will be a success in the Premier League either with Southampton or in the future with another club. I think he deserves a chance in the Premier League as all of his teams play football in the right way and love to get the ball forward and attack. The passing game the Saints have employed this year has been very good to watch and has cut open many opposition defenses. The only disappointing thing for Adkins is that he has failed to win both League 1 and the Championship but I don’t think the fans should care as they have gained promotion and are now back in the big time, which seemed very unlikely when they were relegated to League 1.

The "outdoor" varieties, meanwhile, are actually able "to be buried within a hillside"; however, they "must be able to withstand the bearing pressure of any overlying material, eg. soil or snow. This is usually addressed by making the caving structures in sprayed concrete that has been specifically engineered to withstand the loads. Alternatively the cave passages can be constructed in polyester resin and glass fibre but then they have to be within a structural 'box' if soil pressure is to be applied."

After making Light Whole Wheat Baguette I had some dough sitting in the fridge I wanted to use up and I didn't want to make more bread. I had read this dough can be used for pizza dough so I decided to give it a try. I had read on a couple blogs about Mexican Pizza and have been wanting to give try it. My pizza was very light on cheese. I would prefer much more. One time I put a little extra cheese on the pizza and Hasan took a couple of bites and stopped saying he didn't like it. So to make sure he would eat it I went easy on the cheese. He also has another condition that the cheese must be yellow. Once I tried to put mozzarella and he didn't eat it because it wasn't yellow.

However, Amy soon realises that not all star signs are a good match for her after a few disastrous dates but she's determined to keep going until she's dated each of the signs. Cue some pretty hideous dates, some funny ones and some fairly nice ones as well... but Amy finds herself shocked when someone from her past makes a surprise reappearance. Is Amy going to find love with her astrological soul mate, or is love already written in the stars for her?

At least 200 such cases have come to light in Jharkhand where an agency had provided only the iris details to generate Aadhaar numbers by misusing a provision in the UID guidelines that says one biometric detail, either fingerprints or iris, is allowed if one is of poor quality or not available. It is called forced capturing.

The diagram above from Dummies will work but for it to be big enough for a family it would have a huge sheet of expensive and breakable glass. This solar still works by shining sunlight onto a warming pan at the bottom and evaporating the warm water and then condensing the humid moisture rising from it onto the glass at the top. This distilled water then runs down the inside of the glass into a catch trough at the bottom and then off into a storage container. The system as diagrammed is very inefficient because, for example, the condensing glass itself needs to be cool but it is also heated by the sun so it doesn’t condense very well.
Learning to label oneself an “Artist” seems like a rite of passage in the process of artistic formation. What I have come to realize is that it feels safer to downplay anything about myself that another may have the power to reject or ridicule. If I call myself a Songwriter and proclaim myself as such to others, someone else may very well listen to my music and say, “I don’t like it. She’s not very good. She is no songwriter.” Another person certainly has the ability to say that of me, but that ability does not make my artistic endeavors illegitimate. We have all been made to function in unique and specific ways that are not dependent on the approving response of others. Nonetheless, the response of others is a key part of artistic formation since we learn and grow as we share our work with one another in a relational context while experiencing mixtures of rejection and affirmation. In extending ourselves to one another, we risk artistically and relationally.
The point of all this is to spread the fabricated story that “vaccines are essentially safe” and thus there is no harm in mandating that the entire population be injected with them.
Have a go: Pats one goal winning margin is 11/4 with Bet365. This would have been a winner in Tallaght had Rovers not scored with the final kick of the game. If Monaghan can keep their discipline they’ll make it hard for Pats, but will most likely fall short.
Yesterday I read The Summer I Turned Pretty by Jenny Han. Yesterday. Because I could Not Stop Reading. It was one of those books you just dive right into and don't want to loosen from your grip. When I wasn't reading it, my fingers were practically twitching to pick it back up again. The story is simple, it's not this big concept or anything, but I just loved it. And now, after reading it, I want to go lay on the beach. And I'm wishing I had a summer home for my kids to go to every year. Sigh. Check out this quote- probably my fave from the book:
EDITOR’S NOTE/UPDATE: Astute commenters have made the point that this is, in fact, not a QR code at all; it’s a CP tracking code. But Hal Thomas makes a great observation that the similarity could easily fool consumers (including this author) into thinking it’s a QR code and generate confusion.

Bananas also have a high potassium content which helps to replace electrolytes that are being lost. We didn't have carob powder, and the only bananas we had were sliced and frozen, thus I decided to have a banana smoothie. I had about 2 bananas worth of slices with rice milk (I am lactose intolerant, so this is all I have, but it was good as well because dairy products are a bad choice when suffering from diarrhea.) and a little bit of vanilla extract. This was quick, simple, tasty and began to ease the problem within the hour. I was still having less severe bouts though with a lot of stomach pain.

And Monday day off! Up early to 6am Bikrams with my 'man' and then we went to our favorite organic coffee shop for a strong americano and then down to the beach to hang by the ocean for a while. We live in one of the most beautiful cities every. We live 1 block from the ocean, with snowy capped mountain views across the waters, lots of healthy organic restaurants and overall healthy active lifestyles here. I love it and am so grateful for everything in my life!! This weekend we went for a hard 4 hour bike ride, 2 hour hilly run and then drove up island for a family easter dinner. Today I get to relax and do some gardening!!

"Loneliness is an aspect of the land. All things in the plain are isolate; there is no confusion of objects in the eye, but one hill or one tree or one man.

Your imagination comes to life, and this, you think, is where Creation began." -- Momaday

Jealousy comes from insecurity and lack of confidence. When you’re jealous, you’re telling yourself you’re not as good as someone else, or that you’re not worthy of having what someone else has or of succeeding or reaching a goal. Jealousy creates an emotional war inside of you, part of you throwing a temper tantrum, insisting you should have this object, person, circumstance and another part of you saying you’re not good enough, smart enough, rich enough, whatever standard of measure you’re using against yourself. You are only warring against yourself, no one else. So until you decide to end the war and love yourself first, you’ll probably not reach the goal. Remember, love yourself first and most everything else will fall into place.

Dear Kristen,
Today we start the How by discussing non-examples.

You’ll want to read the entire post but here’s the Cliff Notes version of a few of Carl’s suggestions:
There is a common understanding now that a couple should work to make the most of their earning capacity. It's fine if that is what your priority is, or if your circumstances compel both of you to focus on earning money to set yourself up and pay off debt. However, some people value staying at home, being a homemaker, raising children, looking after parents in their old age or volunteering, and for them, that is more important than earning as much money as possible. There are many who have disabilities and who can't work for a living but who save money at home and get by on a pension. It is possible to live well both ways - either by earning as much as you can, or by saving as much as you can. I gave up my career a few years ago, so you all know what camp I'm in. We know that if we cut back on our wants and buy only what we need, we don't need as much money as we used to earn. I spend my time now working from home as a writer, working in my community and working at home. I know many homemakers who have set up a small business that they run successfully from home.
Though our sins are forgiven by absolution, there commonly remains some temporal punishemnt to be undergone either here or in Purgatory. Holy Mass, if well made use of, is abundant satisfaction to the Divine Justice for our debts, though ever so great. What a comfort ought this to be to those who, by reason of their natural constitution, are not able to practice many or great austerities; and what return should we make to our Saviour for the same.

Great idea number 6. Find a media that you completely love and use it! All the time. Do some research and refine your skills. See what it can do as you draw draw draw! I would suggest 3 or 4 grey lead pencils would be a good start – 6 or 4B, 2B, HB and an H of some sort. Each of these pencils have different qualities whether it be the High Bs allowing you to get really dark tones or the H being useful for intricate details that complete the drawing but don’t overpower the image. My other favourite drawing mediums are inks, oil sticks, oil pastels and Pitt pens. Whatever your medium of choice is look for ways to use it in a different way, e.g. cross hatching, stippling (dots), layering or scratching back and rubbling out. I find that having different ideas to try extends my desire to keep drawing.
But does my full-time specialty motherhood have to signify the end of this here blog? I don't think so.

My husband and I are former lunatic liberals. We promoted multiculturalism, the arts and diversity, and we have been involved in our neighborhood association, “urban renewal,” and the urban homesteading movement in our city. We always thought our interracial relationship was progressive. After marriage we associated with a local group of liberals who dug up their yards to plant food, composted, built rain barrels, breastfed their babies, practiced attachment parenting, planned community gardens, used clotheslines, etc. We did these things too, and in our liberalism, we felt very progressive. We were very popular with our white liberal friends because we were the token interracial couple.

The next day a couple of my roommate's friends from Tuscaloosa came to my house in Montevallo to charge their phones. I heard first hand from a student who had been pulling crushed dead bodies out of rubble the night before.

This is the kind of stuff you don't hear about on the news.

We are stocked up on apples and bananas, and I'm running to Sprouts this afternoon for mandarins & grapes, and maybe a pineapple is they look nice. I have some chicken stock at home, waiting for some diced veggies to be added - I'll keep that in the fridge and spoon some out when I get hungry, maybe add leftover fish to it or some chicken for a quick and tasty lunch.

A final difficulty (for our purposes) generated by the online environment is what I will call Gnosticism. Gnosticism is a heretical way of thinking that denigrates the physical in praise of the spiritual. As such, the online environment, as a space of disembodied discourse, is a profoundly Gnostic place. Online we are pure minds, without bodies, sharing our thoughts and interacting as pure spirits in a kind of metaphysical space.
Together were Simon Peter, Thomas called Didymus, Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, Zebedee’s sons, and two others of his disciples.

F: Robin van Persie (Arsenal) – Simply the best. Better than all the rest. That may be a tired clichéd Tina Turner lyric from the late 80s, but it applies here. Sure, he hasn’t scored from open play in the last 8 games, but no one can deny the brilliant season RvP has put together in 2011-12. Were it not for those two guys going bananas in Spain, he’d be probably be getting hyped as the best player in the world right now, but as long as he stays in North London where he belongs, that’s fine with me.
He looked down, frowning briefly in contemplation, before a flicker of amusement ran across his face. The gesture was familiar by now, though Pevan had no idea what thought or memory might be provoking it. Van Raighan's normal mien was grim, even angry. Fair enough, since he had to ask permission when he needed the toilet, and be escorted there and back.

“The Jimmy” as James sometimes likes to refer to himself, decided to go on a bike ride to the lake the other night. He hasn’t ridden much this year. He felt glorious pumping his legs as the bike cruised to full speed. He had the wind at his back and nothing could stop him. He felt like he could ride on forever. He hit the lake and slowed into a U--turn to go back toward home. He immediately felt the strain on his legs as a stiff wind hit him in the face and made his hair lay flat back. He hadn’t realized how hard the wind was blowing as he was riding along with it. Now, as he faced the wind, his face turned red and the ride was becoming a great effort. He down shifted to the lowest gear and pushed ahead. He did not let the wind stop him, but it did whip him. He was beat when he got home. He walked in the door panting and red faced, beads of sweat trickling down his face. I was a little worried about the toll he had just taken on his out-of-shape body, but he recovered nicely and wasn’t even sore the next day.
The Solution: Acknowledge It Sometimes, despite your best preparation, your nerves get the best of you.

But wisely, Hitchcock and Hunter are at the same time, involving us in the developing relationship between Daniels and Brenner. He is physically attracted to this beautiful woman and at the same time charmed that she would go to all the trouble of purchasing the love birds and delivering them to Cathy as a surprise. Brenner asks her to stay in Bodega Bay and have dinner; she accepts, as she is attracted to this young man, who despite his professional success, seems to be in need of attention from someone outside of his immediate family, that being his sister and his anxiety-ridden mother Lydia (beautifully portrayed by Jessica Tandy), whom he lives with in this coastal town.

In reality, Luther wrote the seminal document on-site, meticulously painting it onto the oak with a fine single-haired brush. What bothered the church elders more than what the manuscript said was the fact that he was always in the way, blocking the main entrance almost constantly during the three weeks it took him to finish. Most of the demands were not that unreasonable – for example, he wrote of the need for sturdier pews to “accommodate the ample Germanic hind.” He also wanted Wednesday night services moved to Tuesday because most members couldn’t TiVo floggings in the public square like the wealthy clergy could. And he wanted the liturgy conducted in native languages because Latin “sounds too much like they’re just making it up as they go along.”

In the years before “Dallas”, Larry Hagman was best known as the button-down astronaut who dreamed of Jeannie. But secretly he had a wild streak high and wide enough to land a 747 on. When he wasn’t toasting another sunrise with his next-door neighbor Keith Moon or dropping acid with David Crosby he was working hard to get this, his dream project, made. It’s a very strange, very loose sequel to the 1958 teen horror classic THE BLOB. The free-wheeling performances and absurdist humor are unlike any other movie we’ve ever seen. Hagman was obsessed with making this movie, often going without sleep for days on end, deeply worrying his friends and associates. Unfortunately the film was critically ignored upon release and Hagman retreated to the forest where he lived like an animal for several years before accepting the role of J.R. Ewing and returning to the forefront of American consciousness as the man you love to hate. More popular than ever, he was nonetheless a scorned and broken man whose one-of-a-kind film-making genius has never been fully appreciated. Until now. Join us for this very rare screening of Larry Hagman’s one and only film as a director, starring Robert Walker Jr., Burgess Meredith, Godfrey Cambridge, Marlene Clark, Gerrit Graham, and Shelly Berman.

I run two magazines on my war-belt solely for speed reloads. Any "tactical reloads" come off my chest carrier or plate carrier. Despite the nay-saying of some supposed "guerrilla gurus" and "Tactical Timmy's, there are at least three times in a fight when a speed reload is absolutely critical, and not simply a "gamer's gimmick." One is the first mag-change in a fight (I'm talking light infantry fights here, not home defense, just to clarify). Once you've gained fire superiority with your first burst of fire, you need to maintain it, even if not at the same rate-of-fire. Keep your gun in the fight until the rest of your element is keeping up as well. After that, you can worry about magazine retention. The second is when you are providing suppressive support-by-fire for your Ranger buddy, If your weapon goes down while he is exposed, for ANY reason, you need to get it back into the fight before he is killed, and fuck a lost magazine! Finally, any time you need to reload whole you are moving in the open (if you're in the open, not shooting, and not moving, you should be focused more on basic tactical skills than on speed-reloads), whether due to running it dry (whoops! You fucked up! It happens--get over it!), or a malfunction, you need to get your gun back into the fight, not worry about losing a god-damned magazine. If you win the fight, you can go look for the lost magazine, or take replacements from the dead bad guys. If you lose the fight, you're going to have bigger concerns than a lost magazine. Things like, "I wonder what St. Pete made for supper tonight?" and "I DID go to confession last weekend, right?" (for the record, I am neither Catholic, nor anti-Papist. The joke just worked well.)

She's put her acting career on hold for now too, because she wants to be home with us more. I think that's probably good, for now. She needs to give herself time to regroup and figure some things out, and a little break will help her do that. She still has a contractual obligation for the Sesame Street video, so there will be a few more trips to New York to finish that up, but then I think she'll lay low for a little while. By the way, the Sesame Street people have been wonderful and supportive, and we truly appreciate their understanding with the scheduling delay. Some of the material in the video hits a little too close to home right now, and they had to cancel one of the filming sessions in December because Katie just couldn't get through the scene. She felt terrible about that, but they were so understanding and supportive, and they told her to take as much time as she needed. In a business where "time is money", it's refreshing to find that kind of support from the people at the top. And considering that they're making a video about children coping with grief, it's nice to know they stand behind the message they teach.

Just how life will all unfold is unknown to us now, but I hope with all my heart that the opening of our hearts to each other has been of some benefit to us both, and that the wisdom and abundant goodness our connection contained will sustain us as we move beyond today, and endure for the remainder of our lifetimes.
The truth is very simple: it is harder to get into the sorority that is Vogue UK than it is to run for President. It's not just because I'm American: this is a very tight group and they only hire their 'kind': an intern will be the boss's friend's daughter.. and it is so not a meritocracy...

NOT to mention what the heck does a thief want with a snowman anyways? They are not exactly lightweight to carry. Remember how heavy those extra large snowballs are to heave up on top of each other? Did he run down the road with it in a wheelbarrow giggling to himself at his accomplishment? What did the neighbors think if they saw it happening? How drunk do you have to be to think it is a good idea? What is the payoff here? Did he think it was something else? Did he have a sick kid at home who wanted one and he was just too lazy to make it for him? Is there a snowman dealer somewhere waiting to fence it to someone else for a profit? Do they paint it with food coloring or something first to disguise it so the original owner won't be able to identify it? Are they going to break it down and sell it for parts?
Set the whole thing on a long piece of oiled foil and pull the foil over the top to form a loose parcel.
Summer may be just around the corner, but May has many more spring delights for you. It is still a month of transformation, as greenery continues to explode with life. This can be a great time to take photos, as delicate new tree leaves are still fresh and bright.

His rampage ends with him exploding a car with a pistol. This sequence of events is an incredible bit of trashy horror cinema, outdoing anything in the original movie. Indeed, were it not for the abundance of flashbacks and filler, Silent Night, Deadly Night 2 would make an even better movie than its predecessor. At once, it is one of the best and worst sequels ever made.
Scars draped her arm like a scarf. A very disgusting, mutilated scarf that shows her temporary way out. Physical pain covers her emotional pain.
Another problem with leaving subtle clues is trying to fool your main character without fooling the reader. In one novel I have a character who breaks character often. In the first draft I just had her do that so once the reader found out why she was doing it they would go, “So that explains that.”

We had, admittedly, a long drive. One of the (many) distractions was a bag of wrapped ‘surprises’ – every few hours (or maybe hour, depending on how antsy Pete was getting) we’d let him pick a new one. Some Cars toys, coloring books or stickers, a new little stuffed animal – certainly helped to pass the time. He was a super-good traveler. Which was good, because our U-Haul went about 55 mph so it took a looooooong time. We stopped in Des Moines for the night and wouldn’t you know, they were having some huge Track & Field thing so we were lucky to get the last room at a Country Inn and Suites. My goodness.

I grit my teeth a bit and flush when I read bloggers talking about how this was the “easiest quarter” in over a decade. I have, undoubtedly, SUCKED ASS since the start of the year. My lull in January can be attributed to a lack of energy/effort toward the market, but I have been strapped into this shitty office chair since mid-late February and I’m just not hitting my stride.
The whole audition is for Aoyama to cherry-pick his ideal woman from a group of women who have been fooled into applying for a role that will never be theirs. The process, whilst given frothy backing music, exposes the women to probing questions designed to root out ones Aoyama would find unacceptable. It is a glorified cattle parade for Aoyama to vet women to find one fulfil his high expectations without the women being given an equal footing they would get in a real date. The women range from normal to strange and although there is some comedy in the scene it is undercut by the fact that the women are hoping to gain a big break and exposing themselves to men who could not care less about them.
It turns out, I seem to be missing that piece.

While there is any number of great shorter “songs” on any of the aforementioned releases, they are dominated by piercing lead guitar work, longer instrumental passages, and watery keyboard/organ fills. Psychedelic might mean Grateful Dead/Quicksilver Messenger Service to some, to Nick it is a hyperextension of what Jimi Hendrix was doing. He layers plenty of raw guitars that explode out of the studio speakers, no time limit as to when the lava will stop flowing off his fret board. The problem with trying to classify his output is that you have such ultra-Pop gems like “Lights Are Changing” (Triptych) on the same cd with the 19:47 long “Tangerine Infringement Beak”. Let’s not split hairs- Saloman will always be a stylistically divergent cat. Remember that a maps job is to get you close to where you want to be.

Situated at 6,360 feet over the sea level, the place is marked having journey attractions like Naini Lake, Naina Devi Temple, Hanumangarh Temple, Cheena Peak or even the Naina Top, Snow View point, St. john Church, Zoological Garden as well as the British Cemetery.
Unlike the Norkfolk State players, hitters like Tomo Delp, .281 for the season with four home runs, had great patience with the pitches he received, which allowed him to hit a double and eventually reach third with a steal at the bottom of the fourth.

I chose this topic as I know how people can get hung up on them there pesky 'rules' of creative writing (though 'guidelines' might be a better word). It's easy to internalise them to the extent that they stifle any creative spark that's struggling to push its way out from your clogged-up brain. Just as it's about to emerge, blinking in the sunlight, it's clobbered by someone wielding a big stick and shouting, 'You can't do that!' And that has to be a Bad Thing to anyone who loves shaping words into stories and doing something different and fresh.
Monzon is definitely not the first to toy with fact that human marks and designed surfaces have few visual differences. This is a major question in painting extending from Picasso, through Johns, and into the painting of today (to some, it is the question that killed painting for good). Think of Picasso’s ripping of Seurat’s pointalism out of optic theory and placing it as a pattern on an armchair, think of Lichtenstein transforming each “style” from German Expressionism to Cubism into his system of painted Ben-day dots, think of Warhol’s comparison of a Rorschach drawing to the flowing fields of Morris Louis and Taaffe using snakes from field guides to mimic Pollock’s paint skeins.
TB: Like most of us, I probably first met the Big Bad Wolf in fairy tales, particularly the stories of Little Red Riding Hood and the Three Little Pigs. In the originals, the wolf would have been a figure of terror, a predator who pounced on the weak and vulnerable. But a long process of bowdlerisation had turned him into a figure of fun, a fool who thinks he’s clever but who is defeated by the young.
Instead, I decided to go with my new favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe. It's the Jacques Torres cookie recipe that's been all around the internet, but I tweaked it to suit my tastes. This recipe is very forgiving. I've used all purpose flour instead of bread flour and I've also baked the cookies the same day instead of waiting 24 hours. Both turned out just as delicious.

In fairness, Hofstadter didn’t just focus on the intellectuals, he cited the views and actions of the so-called Robber Barons as proof that the conservative mind had adopted Darwinism on a massive scale. He writes:
These are powerful words and actions---love, empower, explore, coach, aid, listen, learn, care about/for, enable, encourage, provide opportunity, open to outcome, committed to the child's self-determination. With some changes and adaptations in thinking, these could easily reflect the role of the parent; I know many, many families in which this is true.

All that we heard about the ‘Singhvi sexcapade’ was the involvement of a hapless driver, who was supposed to have served his master for years together, who left service without any notice for reasons of personal grudge and whose apparent idea of revenge was gluing his master in nothing less than a ‘sexcapade’! The story appears to be anything but credulous. Not even the most uncreative director from Bollywood will have a similar plot for a thriller movie: Manish Kumar Lal, the irate driver of Abhishek Manu Singhvi divorced himself from his master of many years without any notice. The reason: the masters’ dogs sank their teeth into the driver’s pregnant wife and with the baby born handicapped, the driver nursed vengeance against Singhvi. Added to this happens to be an allegation that his monthly payment was not upto the mark. A perfect plot for revenge to brew up in the driver’s mind. And with Nemeses working so well, the man resorted to porn as ultimate form of retribution.

The riff raff on the streets attacking the British embassy and cheering the theft of assets that other people have paid for are anything but the elite; they are the scum that Jews like Kirchner always need to pander to to maintain their hold on power. I have come to the conclusion that whenever one sees an appeal to patriotism or even nationalism by a leader these days then you can take it as a given that he is either a Jew or a creature of the Jews. The days of Codreanu are long since gone and these days accidents can be arranged long before anyone who is a threat in that respect can come to national prominence. Their demise will ultimately come but it will come in an entirely unexpected way that none of us can yet foresee; let us put to one side fantasies about the likes of Putin or Ahmadinejad saving us.
Anyway, ate at Nino’s and had a few beers. Got a few Changs for the road and met up with Liz, Dan, Ali and others. By the time we caught the bus at 8:45, I was probably 5 beers deep. This was going to be a fun night. At the beach party I had a few more. Saw a bunch of people and had a chill time dancing on the beach. Here’s where the timeline gets screwed up. I remember T.J. (or maybe it was Stephanie) grabbing my arm and telling me to come wade out into the sand dunes. I drunkenly followed and broke my flip flops in the process. It felt so good to wade in the ocean that I didn’t care my pants were soaked up to my crotch.
This past summer we moved from the East coast to the West coast. Coming from a 105 year old row house in Baltimore I was used to decorating small narrow spaces, but this rental house presented me with quite a design challenge. The living room is only 9.5x8 with three walls of windows. I immediately knew it would be difficult to incorporate color and texture without the help of wall art and the space for multiple upholstered pieces of furniture. However, I didn’t let this challenge deter us because this little house may be smaller than we were used to but it packed a lot of visual punch. The rustic wood ceilings were the original floors of the house before it had been rebuilt and the gorgeous light poured in from the windows making it impossible to do anything but embrace this space. Decorating it has been a labor of love but worth every minute because it has taught me a lot about using every inch of space.
They make us.
My color combo came from the SU color wheel: Daffodil Delight, Night of Navy, Old Olive and Cherry Cobbler. I used the Fanciful Flourish die from Cherry Lynn and the Textile Texture embossing folder from Cuttlebug. i trimmed off the overhanging parts of the flourish before embossing it along with some paper flowers. Then I went back and glued the parts back in place and added brads to the flower centers. I used the same embossing folder on the Daffodil Delight layer.
I have always thought the Chinese curse “May you live in interesting times” was a rather attractive prospect.

Actually writing out my schedule yesterday made me recognize something. I think that a big part of this growing up process involves being real about your situation. I'm of the belief that we only get one life, but even if that's not the case, right now is happening, so why live it the way that you want? It's difficult though, sometimes, to answer the questions that lead to what you want: What physical things do I want? What mental things do I want? What emotional things do I want? What about abilities? How do I want to show up?
Nobody likes rewrites, or rather, nobody likes the thought of rewriting. However, the actual act of 'killing your babies' is never quite as bad as that expression suggests, and I quite enjoy seeing how an editor or agent sees certain passages of my work differently to the way that I did when I originally penned it. Normally, their suggestions are made to make the book 'sing' when it's started to 'hum' a little, and it's all too easy as the originator to not be able to spot these sticking-points in your work.

The skills I learned in news editing helped me carve out a bigger role for myself in the office because I’m now trusted to copy edit and review corporate communications before they leave our department and to take such precautions as proofreading my Tweet before posting.

There was also the chance that a game of Trivial Pursuit would break out, which would eventually devolve into a lot of swearing, and when you're a kid, hearing your elders cursing over their lack of trivial knowledge is damned funny. The adults would play the game, the kids would play with our toys or watch the marathon of shitty stop-action animation holiday specials that was broadcast on Channel 55 for the three days prior to and including Christmas Day. It was bliss.
Age 8. The best part of the day is going through notebooks. Those of you with school aged kids know what I'm talking about. All kinds of treasures tucked in pockets and folders. All of the sudden their people with two strands of hair and spike ball hands become beauty queens. Nickelodeon has certainly not had any influence on her. But I have to wonder about these people with football shaped heads. Can't be Nickelodeon. Can't. It's not. Nope. Uh-uh.

I think it would be safe to say that the best performance out of this whole film, and probably the best thing about this flick really is Blythe Danner here as Nana. Danner is that wise, funny, and always witty old lady that has something to say and made me laugh just about every time. And with a film like this, you need any type of humor just get you through. It’s a small compliment but it’s a compliment to this film none the less and this film needs all of that it can get.
About a year later, I changed doctors and she changed my medications and we began seeing some improvement. She told us as soon as my lupus was in remission there was no reason we could not have children. About another year later, all my tests were good, I had not had a flare up and we decided it was time.
Soon a rabble of priests and soldiers showed up with swords to take Jesus away. Judas was among them and pointed him out. His disciples ran away and Jesus was left to face his tormentors alone.
I then brayered and sponged Cherry Cobbler ink all over as shown. To get the white-ish edges on the card base and this patterned background piece, pour a little white embossing powder in your tray and run a VersaMarker along the edges of each. Dip the edges in the white embossing powder. Manipulate the powder (using a brush) before heat setting so you get the desired thickness and look.
Let’s go further and talk about ‘openness’ in the context of rising economic nationalism and a double dip recession which strains the fiscal rectitutde of all euro member states. Europe is going to become more conservative, more nationalistic and more xenophobic on European-wide issues like free trade, open borders, and free labour movement. The same is true in the US. As I said in April:
BROOKLYN, N.Y.—Because I was back in East Brunswick on Friday and Saturday catching up with family and friends, my theatrical cinematic explorations this weekend were limited to two new releases, both of them pleasant—or, in the case of Danny Boyle's 127 Hours, pleasant with generous doses of agonizing—surprises.
And we can't forget his "nice" smile. He made this up all on his own when we were walking through an airport to pick up my mom (when she came out for Dallin's birth). He was riding on Chris's shoulders and everyone we passed he would look at with his "nice" smile. It was adorable and made many people smile.
Rel's head ached. His empty stomach clenched his gut like a fist. His wrenched shoulder held the tight sensation that presaged pain at the slightest hint of sharp movement, not helped by the stiff wrist from the earlier fight. The front of his brain felt cold and vacant, the back like a lump of wool. But the shining figure bearing down on him poured the warmth of familiar anger across everything, gave him strength. The Stable Rod, warm in his hand, promised a major advantage if it came to a fight, and he still had some Clearsight left, even with the Sherim pressing chaos against his mind.
As a baby I'm sure that I put some miles on them, crawling around, testing them, learning how to walk. Later, it was hopscotch, skip-it and jump rope. Tree climbing and bike riding. Hiking and swimming, my knees and I did it all and made it through life with only a few scrapes and bruises between us.

His words move me, because they are so raw and honest. And at the same time as the lyrics seem to convey utter despair over one thing or another (usually having to do with the tricky aspects of love), they somehow make me feel hopeful about the world.

Getting back to the bastard motif, the opportunities for Carla to vocalize bastard-based zingers seemed to diminish the deeper she waded into the vengeance pool. Besides, what are you supposed to say after you cut a mechanic in half with the jeep he's working on, push a man into an industrial-strength ice maker, and ventilate a man's forehead with a shotgun? I mean, "subdural hematoma, bastard" is a bit of a mouthful.

It may be caused by a brain injury, trauma to the head, or ear infections. It has also been linked to environmental factors, such as turmoil in the child's home life.
Now, it would be one thing to come out and say "Yes, I agree that the 'burbs have encroached on Farmer Johnson's backyard range, and maybe we should look into this," but the bit about the guns he sells today not being like the guns he sold 35 years ago is just gratuitous B.S., mugging for the camera, and he knows it. The AR-15's he's selling now are no more potent than the ones he was selling in the '70s. I am once again proud of the fact that I have never set foot in this jackhole's shop, nor will I ever.

This is one of the very best YA series I have ever read and it's definitely worth picking up. I think I love this series most because of the real-life drama and situations these teens are put in. The situations are indicative of what could truly happen in today's world and that's what makes it so exciting and thrilling. Packed with a combination of heart-wrenching teen angst and heart-stopping action with the threat of some really bad people, this is one you don't want to miss!"

What stands out in my mind throughout the difficult process is how the Principal was not only professional but personable as well. She advocated for Fred and focused on what he needed to help him succeed. She followed his progress and honored his individuality. She inspired me to be a teacher, and taught me that as a teacher I have a tremendous responsibility to see my students as unique individuals and to advocate for their specific needs. I hope when I am faced with situations such as Fred’s, I will be slow to judge, quick to support, and patient be with frustrated and hurt parents. I want to be sure that as I listen to their words, I truly hear what both the students and the parents are saying. I want to be the true advocate for those students and parents that others were for me and my son.
Without having a booking agent or label support, John would sneak into empty offices at work to make calls to venues to try and get them gigs. At one point he was able to book them a short tour which got a mention in NME, but they never landed themselves on a bill with a large act. Nonetheless, they did catch the attention of Future Earth Records who signed the band.

My posts of La Maison are always long, filled with pictures of the stylish and beautiful vignettes and rooms throughout Pat and Stephanie's store. It's hard for me to stop pressing the button on the camera when there is so much inspiration at every turn. And though the photography here is good, I promise you - visiting the store is 100 times better. Unfortunately though, there won't be many more La Maison Home posts. (At least not at this location!) By the end of September 2012, Pat and Stephanie will be closing the doors of La Maison Home at their location in Chadds Ford. Many sale prices will be on pieces now through September. So if you've been resisting visiting their store - now is the time to bite the bullet and take a tour! I promise, you won't be disappointed!
Bruce Woolley: Ghost Train
This was a crazy, crazy week. On Monday, it was announced who are new principal will be for next year. It's the guy who does my job for the upper grades at our school. We've worked closely together for the last two years and I'm super excited for him and know he'll do a great job. However, I also found out on Monday that they've decided to get rid of our positions. They've decided to add an assistant principal and they hired someone who interviewed for the principal position. They told me that in the restructuring they wanted to ensure I was still a member of the team and they created a differentiated specialist position that they offered me. We're still discussing what that position will look like exactly but it sounds a bit like a combination of the two jobs I had prior to coming to here, which is great. I've been on an emotional rollercoaster all week and I've been stressed and overwhelmed with the changes. I'm excited to see what the new position has in store.
I was terrified, I should mention that. I'd written a novel in which the main character has a doll-head fused to her fist who hides in an ashen cabinet. I'd written about a boy who escapes a Dome to find his mother. I set two lives on a collision course in a landscape populated by Beasts, Dusts, Groupies ... which I can't even truly explain for you here.
Goodness, apparently I just can't get myself together enough to regularly post on this blog. Maybe it's because my life is super boring right now...just a whole lot of working, not enough sleeping, and a puppy who needs our constant attention. Nobody wants to read about that stuff.

First, the rumors…I will begin with the things everyone always says…
Lydia had her first doctor appointment today, and this was also the first time I had been to this pediatrician's office. I really liked them. I told her about Adam and that we may be in there a lot like crazy lunatic parents. She was really nice and told us to come in any time. She was very supportive. Anyway, Lydia dropped to 6 lbs, 13 oz when we left the hospital (she was 7 lbs, 7 oz when born), and is up to 7 lbs, 10 oz now. Everything else is fine with her. We talked about her missing kidney, and the doctor was not concerned at all. She said we don't have to do anything different or special with her as she gets older. The only thing to consider is when she's older and wants to play contact sports. Obviously, this isn't something we need to discuss for years, so that was pretty much the end of the conversation. I'm so happy to hear that Lydia can live a normal life. It was like I already knew that, but hearing it from her pedi makes me feel better about the whole thing.
I love cooking with Taukan (wet bean curd block). It is great replacement for meat and the texture is similar to lean meat. I tried to use western herbs in this recipe. The result turns out ok.

The 10,230 sq m four-storey building will feature study and research facilities, a lecture theatre, a large library and an environmentally controlled archive for rare documents; a prayer hall with traditional dome and minaret tower. The centre includes a 108-foot-high minaret and a 75-foot-high dome. It is estimated at £65 million. We must remember that Oxford, the University of Treachery, is pushing us out in favour of overseas students.

My dear friends Matt and Jill are homeschooling their four children, and they’re doing an awesome job of it. Matt, no stranger to education (he has two master’s degrees) is a great communicator and very involved in his kids’ lives.

Following a series of stress tests earlier this year assessing banks’ ability to withstand a fresh financial crisis, the central bank has asked lenders to set aside more cash for bad loans and to double provisions for restructured debt, after warning that non-performing assets could rise by 25 per cent this year to 2.92 per cent of total portfolios. By comparison, bad loans at US banks last year stood at 3 per cent of total loans, according to Moody’s data.
Our other dog is a tiny Chihuaha called Holly. While she lacks size she makes up for it in attitude and heart. She is a good natured, non yappy, affectionate, child proof, spoilt rotten member of our family.
5. What's your favorite band/artist? I never have a specific answer for this question. Right now I am really liking the honey trees, slow club, givers, leftover cuties, she and him, holcombe waller, and two door cinema club.
My point in all of this is not to be judgmental. I do, however, get exasperated whenever I see someone raving about the absolute perfectness of unschoolers, because that simply isn't the reality. I believe one-hundred-percent that unschooling is the best option out there. That doesn't mean that just because you unschool, you, or your life, will be perfect, and it certainly doesn't mean that if you take a whole bunch of unschoolers and dump them in one place that you're going to get a perfect community. There's always room for improvement, and there will always be important issues to address. I think what we need to do is recognize that, admit it, and then see what we can do about it!
Once the first layer was laid out, the next layer was glued to the top, with the segments overlapping by 50%. Using clamps to hold the segments whilst the glue dried was not an option, as I didn’t really want to disturb the segments in lifting them to install clamps. Small screws were used instead. These would be removed once the glue dried. During the process, measurements across the diameter were checked to see that I was in fact making a circle!
It’s exactly what you’d expect from a Michael Bay film. Alot of explosions, epic action, slow motion, plenty of American propoganda and a melo-dramatic speech from a squeeky clean president.
Vigan is known for its preserved heritages. It is a World Heritage Site in that it is one of the few Hispanic towns left in the Philippines, and is well-known for its cobblestone streets, and a unique architecture that fuses Philippine and Oriental building designs and construction, with colonial European architecture. It is very famous, not only in the Philippines but also internationally. If you must be wondering why the houses look like these, it is because, like what I’ve said earlier, it is preserved since the Spanish Era in our country. That was hundreds of years ago.
The whispers in the morning of lovers sleeping tight. Are rolling by like thunder now as I look in your eyes. hold onto your body and feel each move you make, your voice is warm and tender, A ,love I could not forsake.

Bicycling, hiking, and star gazing are among other activities to experience in Austin. Zilker Park offers free concerts every Wednesday between June and August. Outdoor plays where actors interact with the audience can also be enjoyed in another area of this park. If you prefer being pampered, there are a plethora of spas.

Not even an eigth of a mile down the road is also a federal prison camp. The inmates housed there are low security risk. They work around the base. They are janitors in the JAG school. They also do things like landscaping, etc... They're just not allowed to interact with people on the base. The instructors told us that if one of them talks to us tell them immediately and they'll be on a bus back to prison in Atlanta within two hours.

The first half passes and Rachel’s role develops wonderfully. Character of Paige has shown a lot of depth than in the first 30 minutes of the movie. Now, you start feeling connected to the film. You can feel that confusion that Paige feels when he looks at Leo, who claims to be her husband. But she remembers nothing about him. You can feel her trying her best not to hurt him. Even Channing’s character picks up the pace and develops as events start happening. Channing beautifully portrays Leo’s helplessness, which he feels when his wife leaves him out. You can feel Leo’s agony and frustration when he is cut off by the love of his life, as she remembers only the period before she met him. That awkwardness is well displayed between a husband and wife who were soul mates a while ago but have to live as strangers now.

I decided that I wanted something simple and without too many functions (examples: GPS-enabled altimeter, mapping capabilities on the watch, wireless connectivity), so I eliminated the 310 and above.

In contrast, drinks prices in the off-trade have probably risen roughly in line with price inflation. But it’s not that alcohol is underpriced in the off-trade, but overpriced in the on-trade.
Here's a tip on colouring with aquabrush and pencils. Instead of colouring the image with pencils and running a brush over it, you can also take the colours directly off the pencil. You'll get much better control over the application. The colours are more intense, so it's wise to first test on scrap paper. Also, did you know you can actually lick colours off regular colour pencils? It really works! The colours might not be as deep as water colour pencils, and you have to adjust the wetness of your brush, but you can get more variety.
Hey, blogosphere!

These rules hit the nail the head pretty well. The only thing I would change is to remove the last one as mentioned above since it doesn’t apply to my geographical location, and replace it with the rule: if the restaurant is known for a dish, order it. For example, if the restaurant is called “The Spaghetti Factory” then it’s probably advisable to order the spaghetti.

February 25th through March 31st, 2012: The first of many community meetings was held in Oakland on February 25th, and over 100 Pittsburghers turned up to give their opinions on what was important to them as library users. We also collected feedback online, with a live survey that ran from March 1st through March 31st, 2012. You can read about the kinds of questions we asked and the sort of feedback we were looking for in the official discussion guide, which was used by both in-person and online participants. All the information we collected during that time was collated into a summary document that will now drive our next moves.

On a business trip
Oh lovelies, it has been busy since S4 got here. As a matter of fact, I started to get the blues. Not full on depression, but blues. I felt like I was losing control- S1 and S2 had fall break last week, so the timing was bad because everyone was at home. Everyone at home made things a bit overwhelming and I just wanted to sleep. Plus, S4's first pediatrician appointment did not get off on a very positive note (story for another post). So I felt like all I was doing was nursing S4 and being a lousy mom to the rest of the crew including my dear hubby. My oh-so awesome midwife called me and told me that her oh so awesome student midwife would bring over my encapsulated placenta and some dark chocolate for me within the hour. Mind you, it was already about 8pm....
... they were given homemade, light wheat, french bread with a jar of strawberry freezer jam or a loaf of brown sugar, cinnamon, raisin swirl bread. I sure hope everyone enjoyed. I won't be baking in mass for a while now.
He just took a few steps and the sight that greeted him made him furious. Santos had of course brought back the mares.

The lazy pervert!

I'm looking hard for redeeming features but there's basically no malt character and what hop there is is just a sharp bitterness, more like something that poured from a plastic tub than infused via the cheery leafy cone some teenager has crayoned onto the label. The bucketloads of fizz do it no favours and... is that vinegar? It gets worse the more I think about it. I'd be better off just moving on to the next beer...
We left Innamincka and headed south down the Stezlecki Track, which was scarred with many massive wheel ruts and slippery sections after the rain. Spent a great night at the Montcollina Bore that is a hot artesian spring, which allowed us to indulge in hot water pursuits.....washing dishes, clothes, bodies etc...Had dingoes hanging around at night. Finally arrived in Lyndhurst at the end of the track, where we desperately needed to refill our water tanks (one still not in operation) repairs would have to wait till we reached a bigger town.

Yes, I actually have these thoughts sometimes…and one day in my FLEX aerobics class, they were running rampant through my head. And continuing…I used to be “one of them,” you know.

Gina, over at Portrait of a Writer. . . Interrupted, reprinted a great article from Mary Demuth on Publishing. In it, she shares her goals as a writer that are not defined by the "success" of publishing. It's a great read for writers, and I think we can apply it to our blogging as well.
I nodded and she turned and began to walk away. I eased back into my seat and my eyes followed her stride. When she disappeared into the house, I suddenly felt it…loneliness. It was there but had been a very subtle presence.

Songwriter, singer, and producer Leon Ware is one of the less-recognized products of the Motown Records music factory of the 1960s and '70s, primarily because he has tended to work behind the scenes despite recording a series of albums under his own name. His signature style is a highly romantic approach to soul music that has resulted in many hit records, notably "I Wanna Be Where You Are," recorded by Michael Jackson, and "I Want You," recorded by Marvin Gaye, both of which he co-wrote.

From the same session as #4. The recording begins by me trying to explain which song I was refering to in a discussion that took place earlier. The original, of which I play a few seconds, was by Flani and Alou and their kamalen n'goni act. Zani needs a few moments to recall the song and Flani helps him by singing a few lines from the song. After a while Zani decides it is better to keep the guitar playing monotonous to imitate Alou's n'goni of the original. This certainly gives the song more pace, and goes on 'till the break at 4'25. The subsequent variations again show Zani's skills as an improviser.
The Arrivals is made by a team of three young Muslim men. In this documentary they explain how depathing works. They made me realize how powerful the devil really is. How knowledgeable he really is, How schemeing can he really be.

Our industry is still using the original wording from the Stone Age like policy, premium, agent and beneficiary to describe the features and benefits of our products. These are not fun words.

Can you tell that this has become a common theme with me recently? The closer I get to actually querying my manuscript, the larger this question looms. Is my work worthy? Do I belong in the club? Or am I like Chuck and his son, star-gazing into a refracted reality? But what about the positive comments I get from my beta readers and critique group, don’t they count for something? Then I remember all of the praise and slaps on the back Chuck and his son received, were those not sincere as well?

Bersih 3.0 is a civil society initiative. It is a coalition of NGOs demanding free, clean and fair elections. Before the rally last Saturday, Bersih leader Datuk S Ambiga made it very clear that it was to be a peaceful event and the sit-in was called by Bersih and not any political party.

It's the last game of a hard-fought season, and an athletic team (the Blue-Blooded Ancestor Hunters?) suddenly finds itself short by one member. Six players are required; they have only five. You're asked to fill in, even though you have no knowledge of the game. That doesn't matter, they assure you, the real team members will carry the ball and do the scoring. All you have to do is stand where the coach tells you to, and be counted. Some sort of reward is offered--fame? fortune? undying gratitude? some skeletons for your closet?--so you accept the deal. The team wins the game, and the highly-coveted blue ribbons are passed out to everyone on the team, including you. Tell me, how meaningful is that blue ribbon to you? Isn't it pretty much commensurate with how much you've invested in the game?Some people do genealogy because it's part of their religious practice. Some do it as a vocation. Many of us do it as an avocation and, oh, how we bristle if our pursuit is reduced to the lowly status of a mere hobby! No matter which category we fit into, though, I'd be willing to bet it's the thrill of the hunt that keeps us going, and that tantalizing prospect of another happy dance possibly just minutes away.
And when the focus on the inconsequential crowds out the things that have a practical impact, we lose. Progressives lose, liberals lose, Democrats lose, everyone who wants to have a fact-based discourse loses, everyone who wants government to solve real problems loses.

2 Pet 1:5-9 (NIV) For this very reason, make every effort to add to your faith goodness; and to goodness, knowledge; and to knowledge, self-control; and to self-control, perseverance; and to perseverance, godliness; and to godliness, brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness, love. For if you possess these qualities in increasing measure, they will keep you from being ineffective and unproductive in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. But if anyone does not have them, he is nearsighted and blind, and has forgotten that he has been cleansed from his past sins.
Compact Florescent Lights (CFL’s). CFL bulbs produce the same amount of light as an incandescent, but use less electricity. Additionally, the bulb can last up to ten times longer, depending upon how often it’s turned off and on. They come in various colors, sizes and shapes, and can vary in hue from warm to bright white to cool. Some are even dimmable.

Saturday consisted of a 5 mile jog at the American Tobacco Trail, where we usually run. I keep saying I'm done for the spring with races, however we did sign up for another one that is in 2 weeks. Maybe that'll be the last one for the spring? I doubt it. HA! Anyways, the trail is quite woodsy and I love the scenic views. When the clouds are out, it's obviously darker in the woods compared to a sunny day and reminds me of Twilight. Somehow I imagine running into Edward out there. After our run we spent the rest of our afternoon at the Great Grapes Wine, Art & Music Festival. It's mostly the same vineyards that attend every year, however we enjoy going just to get out drink great wines and snack on delicious foods. Our favorite drink (and Joe's surprisingly) this year was a unique mixture of a Shortcake Strawberry Wine plus Dark Shadow (the Dark Shadow smelled and tasted very much like a hint chocolate when tasted alone). It was delicious!!! More on this adventure later...

Our third and final day in Marrakech, we finally did something other than shop. We went on a two hour camel trek. It was as cool as it sounds, except that it happened to be the hottest day of our trip, like 105 degrees walking around in a damn oven hot! I sooo regretted not bringing my water with me. Aside from nearly dying from heat exhaustion, the whole experience was awesome, and Carrie Bradshaw and crew ain't got nothin on us!

You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.” (Deuteronomy 6:6-9) If you want to teach godly character, it is important to have it around the home.
Chris Savory, a consultant who was employed as an interim senior manager at the General Social Care Council (GSCC), is one of those who have benefited. He was paid a total of £222,000 by the GSCC through his company, Interim Public Finance Management, for his services from April 2010 to March 2011, on which corporation tax would have been paid. Accounts for the company show it lent him £58,636 that year.

Sometimes it's hard to buy the perfect gift... especially for the boys... and especially when it comes to clothing or accessories. I admit that it is easier to find things for the girls... but maybe that is because I am a girl... If there is one comment that infuriates me it is the one when I hear... 'I couldn't think of anything to give'... 'I've run out of ideas'... 'They have everything'... No one has everything and even if they do... they still deserve spoiling. There can never be too many books, too many scents or too many flowers for men or women... and that is without even pushing the gift giving boundaries. Gift giving is more about the thought behind the gift than any one particular item. A generous gift is one that is tailor made for the recipient and a generous gift is one that has required time and effort to find or make.

Adam Pierończyk belongs to a younger generation of Polish musicians who concern themselves with their national jazz history in a fresh and jaunty way. On his cd Komeda – The Innocent Sorcerer he celebrates a nostalgia-free homage to the sonic universe of the great jazz pioneer and film composer Komeda; And much like his musical ancestor, Pierończyk manages to conjure musical magic with relatively simple means.

The technicalities of broadcasting have resulted in broadcast signals being available beyond the remit of the copyrights the broadcaster has bought since broadcasting first began. In the days of analogue terrestrial television it was possible to pick up UK TV in parts of Holland and Northern France. As the people picking up these signals were few in number and private individuals not engaged in a commercial activity (Dutch bars never picked up on the exciting commercial possibilities of showing Eastenders) it was never considered an issue worth pursuing. Why would a copyright holder of a Hollywood movie that sold the rights to the BBC for broadcast in the UK have much of a problem with a few hundred other people watching it, considering the costs and legal issues involved?

And yet I wonder about that statement, now that I've typed it. Where, exactly, does dutifulness live in a text? Where would I get the perception that a writer was writing dutifully rather than passionately? How would I respond if the writer were suddenly beamed into my living room and said, "Hey, you! I wrote that story because it's a story I had to tell, a story that burned at my fingertips, a story that, if I didn't tell it, would have caused me to spontaneously combust! There's nothing dutiful about it!"
I've been checking out Google analytics and came across a few keywords googled by people who have stumbled onto my blog. I'm sure they were sorely disappointed when they got here:

What’s wrong with her? Is she responsible for his awful aggression? Yet she can’t help but think there’s something wrong with this child — really wrong. And when she says “something wrong,” she invokes that little kernel of anxiety that keeps you wide awake, heart pounding, at 3am with worry about what that something might be. She takes the toddler to the doctor, who gives him an unequivocal thumbs up. Whew — right?

The girl that made up the mean rumor about me tricking someone into getting me pregnant came into my work yesterday. I can't even really describe the physical reaction I had to her presence. I avoided her the entire time, but ugh - I felt it. Racing pulse, increased body temperature, cold, clammy hands. Perhaps I should I have just confronted her.
You know the Bearfighter doesn’t back products or services or experiences very often that he hasn’t created himself. That’s because I am committed to only bringing you the raw thunder you expect from me on our existential romp through time together.

A little while later, same friend starts talking about how one time she was explaining an event to a group of people and said ejaculation instead of explosion. In the uncomfortable silence, she realized her mistake. Once words are spoken, you cannot bring them back. I thought Freudian slip but whatever, apparently, they were not impressed. Bad visual. I think those people had a skewed perception of her for like, forever. It’s a good thing I like her so much.
There is a really big funeral happening in Wujal Wujal tomorrow for a respected old lady from the community. Frankie,a local bama and friend, told me that they have a big feast after the funeral. This afternoon they were preparing a whole bullock, some sea turtle (ngnawia), as well as other meat, and kilos and kilos of vegetables. This will be a very important funeral. I have been told that not many children will be going to school tomorrow either. I won’t be attending, as I did not know her. It would be disrespectful for me to show up.

It's not that unusual, the late-night start. The under-thirty crowd is aggressively nocturnal, apparently, and arriving at a bar close to midnight is cool. By necessity that usually means being there for closing, often a messy thing. Most places in our neck of the woods have a 2:00 am close.

This is a lovely image from Elzybels (no longer available to buy sadly) and its a cute little angel sprinkling wishes, peace and dreams as stardust from her cloud. I coloured her in a soft muted palette and added lots of glamour dust and glitter and matted onto silver mirri. I added a sentiment to the bottom, matted onto more mirri with a top and bottom border of stars using a Martha Stewart punch. Simple, but hopefully effective.

Today saw two minor developments in the continuing saga. First I got a CT scan, this time without the contrast dye that they usually IV into me. The last time they did this they were concerned because I sneezed when I was about to leave and they made me sit around in my johnny shirt for an extra 20 minutes, presumably to see if I would catch pneumonia. Apparently sneezing can be a sign of an allergic reaction to the dye and since this can get fairly fatal they take it pretty seriously. When I mentioned this to Dr. D she said she would get my future CT scans done without the dye and so it has proved to be. The whole exercise is very short, now that they don’t have to muck about with the IV. My next appointment with Dr. D is on the 11th by which time I expect the results to be in. There does not seem to be any reason to worry.
OK, not the point, really. Whichever day you choose for your feast, I have a little suggestion. If you are having roast beef and Yorkshire pudding, that is. The reliable old recipe for Yorkie from the Joy of Cooking can't be beat. But I beat it the other night, easy-peasy and worth a dare.

“I missed you every single day.” Christian’s calm smile met with Addison’s as she climbed back into his lap, straddling his hips. “I’m so glad you’ve found your way back to me.” He wrapped his arms around her waist, the look of sinful love on both of their faces as they formed their own world in the small space between their warm bodies.

Another mom asked me once when we were having a mom’s day of crafting and scrapbooking how I decide what photos to choose from. I paused unsure of how to answer, and then just told her it was really difficult, and at the time I thought I was picky. Surprise to me! I’m not as picky as I think. I thought I put a lot of thought into it before, but this last week I’ve put even more thought into it.
Pulling into the driveway I notice the gate is ajar. “Oh, great,” I mutter to myself. Where have they gone now? As I exit the car, I begin calling, “Isaiah, Isaac, hey, boys, where are you?” No response and no sign of either of them. Walking up to the gate, I scan the lower meadow for either of my wolves; dreading the long drive through the neighborhood searching for them.

I spent the next half an hour fiddling with the cake...trying my best to spread the whipping cream as smooth and even as possible so that it will still look presentable without any piped swirls or rosettes. As stated in most cookbooks, the more swipes you make across the frosted surface, the uglier it will get. In the end, I gave up and simply used the back of a spoon to create some swirls, haphazardly. This is the worst frosting I have done, even the sides looked horrible. Fortunately, those Korean strawberries which I bought on sale were very fresh and looked very pretty, they really made up for my lousy skills.
Yep! It's the night before my birthday, and Linette is my date!

This video needs to be watched again over and over. It is a bit of a David Brent moment, where the flawed 'on camera' persona slips and the even more flawed 'off camera' persona shows through.
There is no recipe or formula to making a good film, (That’s a tiny lie as I personally believe that Jerry Bruckheimer has found, made and bottled the formula to making epic blockbusters. The main ingredient being the repetitive use of the American flag in the back ground. Don’t believe me? Next time you watch Armagedon have a shot for every time you see an American flag, I guarantee you, you’ll be out of it by the end of the first 30 minutes.) but the following thing is what capture me and makes me believe a film is good.

Okay, who remembers The Visible Man??? I found this "educational" toy fascinating as a kid. Apparently this is a model that you actually had to put together yourself, and then you could stare in horror and fascination through the Visible Man's clear plastic..er...skin, and see all his grody organs! Yeah!!! And then what the hell would you do with it? Did the Visible Man date Barbie? Was he displayed lovingly on a dresser? Yeah, I don't know either.
If a man or woman hasn’t cherished you after all the things you’ve done in a relationship, don’t expect them to change all of a sudden. Sometimes it takes hard lessons in life for us to really value the important things in front of us. To be mature is to have the mental capacity to handle things like real adults. To hold your ground and refrained from using derogatory language. It’s the ability to be able to confront things head on and walk away when things aren’t working with your gentleman or lady card in hand. I constantly run in to my ex girlfriend and even though I would have a valid point to not talk to her, I rather say “hello,” give her a kiss on the cheek and walk away.

My husband through all of this was incredible. By now I was unbearably hot so I had him drenching a washcloth in ice water, and then laying it with some ice chips on my head and neck. But his favorite part that he insisted I put in this story was when he started counting out loud. I had warned him I didn’t want that, so as I pushed (with my eyes closed) I started frantically waving for him to stop. According to him, I whacked him pretty hard!! Still, having him there, knowing

Today Target's (or, the two that I've been to today), have 90% off Christmas clearance. Not that there's anything left really, but that was not so much the reason for giving up on the idea. No, I'm just out of money again, otherwise I would probably go look at one more store. Then I'm thinking that I might find just a bit more money, but that I still should just stay around here, maybe buy a few more things I saw at the grocery store, and then maybe on more grocery type things like a loaf of bread instead of Christmas stuff that I might not even use next year.

It is used for joint pain that is better with movement and it will also help with a poison ivy outbreak.

In a shallow dish, combine bread crumbs, Parmesan, Italian seasoning, garlic salt, and garlic. Mix thoroughly. In seperate dish, scramble the eggs. Dip the eggplant strips into the egg, then coat with bread crumb mixture. Arrange in a single layer on a greased cookie sheet. Spritz eggplant strips with cooking spray. Bake at 350 degrees for about 15 minutes, or until golden and crisp looking. Turn sticks over, spritz with cooking spray, and continue to bake for another 15 minutes or so, or until golden and crisp. Serve immediately, as they are best warm. You can serve with a plain tomato or spaghetti sauce as a dip, if desired.

In another province in southern Luzon, some people dug meters deep to get muddy water and they consider the water enough to survive.

Every holiday, and I mean just about every one on the calender, is a celebration for a certain dessert that might mean very little to some folks, but around my house, if it's not made, we are in trouble. I'm talking about Mary's Banana Pudding. Like I said, no matter the season, no matter the holiday, it's either on the dessert table or made to take to some other household. And like I said, if we don't we're in trouble. It's a cold, creamy custard type with ripe bananas and wafers suspended in the vanilla pudding base creating bliss with each mouthful. Sounds pretty good doesn't it but then there's the underlying tartness of sour cream that makes it shine above all other puddings if you ask me.
For the day the SPX/DOW were -0.50%, and the NDX/NAZ were -0.30%. Bonds gained 6 ticks, Crude dropped $1.55, Gold slid $10.00, and the USD was flat.

The shades had started to yellow and were looking a little shabby, not so chic, so when I saw this awesome button trim at Hobby Lobby, I knew what I wanted to do. Honestly, had some new white linen shades just fallen into my lap, I probably would have purchased them and started fresh, but I wasn't much in the mood for hunting for these little guys, so I got out my trusty craft paint in a soft white and some additive that you use to make craft paint fluid enough to paint on fabric. Delta makes it I think, and it is quite handy to have on hand. I painted the shades so they were once again white, left the green trim where it was because I still like it, and glued on the new trim to the underside of the shade. It adds a touch of whimsy so I'm happy.

I feel like one of the themes of my life these days is submission.... God keeps calling my attention to it lately. You see, I'm learning submission one piece of my life at a time. Five years ago God taught me submission in my marriage, and it has brought me amazing freedom. Two years ago God taught my husband and me submission with our plans in life on a larger scale... and it has brought us amazing peace. But today I'm struggling with submission on a daily basis in my home. How do I lay down my daily life? How do I give up my control... of my kids, of my schedule, of my work, of my stress?
This was not just a recognition of “I’m scared that I could have been hurt.” This was “there were cars and trucks coming from the opposite direction. I could have been run over and smashed like the flattened little animals on suburban and rural roadways everywhere. Like the insects on a car’s windshield. Like my body could have been creamed- cremated without even using a hot furnace.”

A public scientologist and especially an OT is demanded to get his or her “stats up”. OTs are run on statistics. Their production is measured. Their value is measured by how many books they sell to “raw public”, how many people they disseminate Scientology to, how much PR they generate for Scientology and above all how much money they can fund-raise for a new building. The focus is on these immediate statistics.

Flip Flop is a fun story to listen to and the writer must be given credit for pulling off such a difficult narrative concept. On the negative side, there is an awful lot of running around and getting frantic. There is also a lack of resolution. We all like stories where there is a definitive conclusion to the narrative and this is impossible for this kind of story.
Not to be missed, anything involving their custard particularly Nielsen's concretes the shakes that make all other shakes feel completely inferior. Available in pretty much every flavor.

I got a room at a reasonable cost on the liveliest avenue the Slope has to offer: The fantastic 7th Ave. The walk to the train station was now a good 7 minutes away, but walking past all the restaurants, coffee shops, and other culinary joints made me happier than a 1 minute walk past Prospect Park in Flatbush ever had. Moving here was a relief compared to from where I had come. And I felt I had really earned it after the hard times I experienced before. No yelling neighbors who wanted to kill their children so they could have some peace. No abused animals barking in the lonely dark. And no bed bugs to worry about anymore.

Are you wondering whether or not I did any exercise?….I did 45 minutes of Zumba! Yay!! It was great fun with the maraca-esque toning sticks, I had forgotten how much I used to enjoy doing it. I kind of tricked myself into doing it by not thinking about it at all beforehand. I knew I would do it after the boys were in bed, so when they put their pyjamas on, I put on my exercise clothes. We had a story, kisses and then I went straight downstairs and switched it on. Too late for trying to wriggle out of it!! It was all just happening on autopilot. This mind of mine does have my best interests at heart, but I seem to manage perfectly well without it for things that my greater intuition knows are right.

As a 2nd year member of the TOS Homeschool Crew, I have been given the wonderful opportunity to review many homeschool products over the next several months. The only compensation that I receive for my review is the free product. I feel truly blessed to be participating in this review group and I'm looking forward to trying out more products and giving you my honest opinion.
This is all about running. You hate these ones. But you hate them because you're jealous. Like non-smokers hate smokers, like the skinny hate the obese. It's the comfort that all those latters obtain, that fucks with all your former minds.
The curtains are hung in the baby's room now too, so I'll show you those once the curtain rod is trimmed and has received it's finials. Fingers crossed, the white panel wall will go up this weekend!

The blog is an important part of my life and I certainly don't intend to neglect it entirely in the coming months as our family settles into a new routine. What I will do is to post as and when I can. Life is all about balancing the priorities; when I have something to say, you can be sure I'll come and tell you about it. Meanwhile, I continue to be very grateful for the love and good wishes that I get from my blogging friends and the readers of One Hot Stove. Thank you all!

The ANC Caucus described the decision as "careless" and "shameless" and the DA's conduct as "unacceptable" - as it represented "a backward tendency that was prevalent during the apartheid era".
Portuguese Bean soup has nice chunks of Portuguese sausage, some type of bean and Macaroni in a tomato base broth. I chose this recipe first since it had Lentils and Butternut Squash and I was interested in seeing how this would make the soup heartier and creamier. (Maybe healthier?) Make sure you have 4-5 hours to make this soup!
If you were to have children, would you choose to unschool them?
On a side note, a goal that I have for this month is to hydrate A LOT more before, during and after my outdoor workouts. With our hot temps, it can be extremely dangerous and I've found myself running mid-day and feeling very dizzy, light-headed and I get goosebumps while drenched in sweat. I know that's my body telling me to slow down, cool off and rest but I push through...and while it's awesome to wanna push myself further, I know that its dangerous. Hydrate, hydrate, hydrate...keep that in mind during the summer months, especially if you live in an area like Texas! Running here in the summer is sort of like running through soup...and I'm not even sure what that means!!! LOL

NDAA proponents sometimes point to an amendment to sec. 1021, added by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, as proof that the NDAA doesn’t apply to Americans. The amendment, now subsection 1021(e), states:
A feasibility study is not the same thing as a business plan. The feasibility study would be completed prior to the business plan. The feasibility study helps determine whether an idea or business is a viable option. The business plan is developed after the business opportunity is created. StrategicBusinessTeam.com explained, “A feasibility study is carried out with the aim of finding out the workability and profitability of a business venture. Before anything is invested in a new business venture, a feasibility study is carried out to know if the business venture is worth the time, effort and resources. A feasibility study is filled with calculations, analysis and estimated projections while a business plan is made up of mostly tactics and strategies to be implemented in other to grow the business.”

1. Be realistic about each other.Don't try to turn your partner into something he or she is not. Let's face it, guys-there's only one Pamela Anderson in the world, and even she has had her implants removed! Give your gal a break and understand that her physical appearance is NOT going to change overnight with the help of a few facials or treatments. And ladies, Brad Pitt has already been taken, so u're gonna have to do with what your guy is like! Chill out, love each other for what u are. There is more to your partner than what meets the eye.
It's not common that I post two times a day, but I feel inspired today. Not sure why, but it might have something to do with my beauty sleep last night - I felt totally rejuvenated when I woke up this morning☺

However McLaren and Ferrari have gone a slightly different route.
Into this volatile, still smouldering arena marched, in summer of 1749, the newly married – and, it has to be said, completely and complacently naïve – Sergeant Arthur Davies of ‘Guise’s Regiment’, in charge of a patrol of eight private soldiers, heading over the mountains from Aberdeen to Dunrach in Braemar, for no more interesting purpose than to keep a general eye on the countryside.
And walked out with a brand new pair of Keens (the blue you see is the color of my socks, not the shoes).

Harvey's not to every ones taste, and he seems to evoke a 'Marmite' style divide - love him or hate him. Mrs P is interested in a number of comics, but has never warmed to his work (although she did really enjoy the film adaptation of American Splendor a few years back). She finds him just too grouchy and his stories just too mundane... which ironically are the two things I love the most about his stuff! But I guess I see more of myself in Harvey than Mrs P does! On the face of it, his work may not look like anything special... a story about the growing awkwardness of someone giving him a lift to work, a conversation he's overheard in a shop, how a vague acquaintance became a better 'friend in need' than any of his true 'friends' when help was needed.... it's everyday stuff. But scratch beneath the surface and see yourself staring right back. I don't find gold in every story, occasionally one will leave me a bit 'non-plussed' thinking "and??" at the end of it. But that's the nature of this particular beast, and no doubt someone somewhere read the same thing and it really spoke to them. I remember reading one of his comics where he was reminiscing about old relationships, how the break-ups had affected him, his thoughts on love and loneliness etc. It was really profound and I kept re-reading it over and over again.

How many of you know — for example — that most babies born (in North America anyway), have an Apgar test within minutes of birth? Did you know the test is named for a woman, Virginia Apgar, a pilot and Columbia University’s first female medical professor?
In his book Darwin’s Black Box, Michael Behe stresses that the structure of the living cell and all other biochemical systems were unknown “black boxes” for Darwin and his contemporaries. Darwin assumed that these black boxes possessed very simple structures and could have come about by chance. Now, however, modern biochemistry has opened up these black boxes and revealed the irreducibly complex structure of life. Behe states that Darwin’s comments on the emergence of the eye seemed convincing because of the primitive level of nineteenth-century science:

Monday, May 14 5-10pm – Mini Beer Festival at The Bayou: The Bayou will be opening every Epic beer they have on hand including one case of the very rare Brainless Corruption brewed in collaboration with DC Brau. If you missed-out on purchasing a bottle, this may be your only opportunity to try it - in the near future. Tickets are limited to 60 people so don't wait to get your tickets. Tickets are available only at The Bayou and are available now. You must present valid ID at the door for admittance both to purchase tickets and to attend the mini-festival.
The universal boozing in MISFITS is exemplary in showing the thin line between an actor drinking during shooting, and then acting drunker than he is, and a sober actor playing drunk. The sober actor might get all the motions and slurs right, but the insulated bi-polar aspect--the ability to careen from jubilant to morose, from possessive to ambivalent, from greedy to benevolent from mopey to Zen, like a drunken slalom---can only come from the hearty heart of darkness, the fortified brand, that limits itself to only three drinks before breakfast, just to kill the shakes, but would kill you if you suggested he or she whittle it down to none. How dare you? And out in the desert heat that kind of buzz balancing can knock you flat on your dehydrated ass. But luckily we reap the benefits, for all eternity, thanks to this weird film. Finally on the big screen there are 'real' drunks the way drunken parents and their drunken friends at outdoor 70s block parties looked to their children, like me.

Another challenge for web designers and marketers is to understand that different visitors have different reasons for visiting a website. A first time user to the website will have a very different experience than a frequent visitor. A website can have many different targets and each target will have their own goal for using a website.

I have recently been working to lose weight by making better food choices (not dieting because dieting is temporary and I want this to be a lifestyle change that will be forever) and getting more exercise. So far, I am down 30 pounds over the last two months and I am very excited about that! I still have about another 60 to go, but already I am feeling better and overall, healthier.
Jami: Oh, yes! Sometimes I still slip back into this anger. He gave. He took away. And then He took more away. I'm infertile. There was a time, though, that I was so angry with Him I didn't talk to Him for a long time. I went through the motions, so no one knew. I stopped singing to Him in my heart. I'd go to church and just stand there during praise and worship -- not singing -- with a cold heart. It was really hard to cut that out of my life. It was so second nature for me to start up a conversation with God... I'd find myself doing just that, remember how angry I was, and stop.

To begin with, in regards to the previous three books, Echoes of the Past is a vastly different book. It is more introspective and deals with a lot of revelations, secrets and intricacies of this universe. For a reader invested in these books, this is the payoff however be warned that this is not the penultimate book of the series and so akin to LOST, these answers while satisfying will lead to more questions gleaned from those very answers. Thematically this book is about identity and the quest to find it. Frank has always wondered about his past and recent events occurring the past books have escalated that need. In this book he finally gets an avenue to explore those needs however the answers he finds might not be the ones he thought they would be. If you didn’t emphathize with Frank before, you’ll definitely do so after reading this one.

So, as I sit here at my clean and neatly organized desk, in my clean and neatly organized apartment, I feel a sense of renewal. I have a new quarter and a new batch of students now. So far, they seem great. Will I feel that way at Week 10? I hope so. But I also know that I might feel otherwise. The point is that I have to simply do the best I can with what I've got, and recognize that what I need in my world is order and balance. I'm simply that way. When it gets out of hand, I have to stop, think, and revise. And it only takes a minute to do.

A week ago, the Greens announced they will move for a Senate inquiry into marriage equality, to investigate Senator Sarah Hanson-Young’s 2010 Bill. Gay News Network reports that marriage equality advocates have welcomed the move as a means to help build up support on the issue before a private member’s bill on marriage equality is voted on by MPs later in the year.

The funny thing was that usually the Boyfriend doesn’t like carrot cake that much, but while I was taking the pictures , he was like « Can I have it now ? Are you done yet ? Why is it taking you so long ? No one would notice if I eat one ! »… He loved them. I wasn’t expecting that. He had lots to eat when I was gone.
The lacrosse team, had a reputation for lively behaviour and under aged drinking, but as I shall show later in this article, they were not the out of control louts which the local police, many of their university professors and national media sought to portray them. However, on that night two of the captains unwisely decided to include some entertainment at the party, by hiring some exotic dancers. One of them then telephoned an agency and booked two white strippers.

My chapter 'Paradoxes, Google and China' is about the blessings of intellectual property and the evil of censorship, two subjects about which both Google and China had some issues.

Together they have hijacked and exercise full control over all the resources including land, labour, capital and revenues from all economic activities such as oil, gas, cocoa, coffee, tobacco, gold, diamond, coltan, tourism and timber exports. Omar Bongo of Gabon and his circle of friends control all the oil money in Gabon. Obiang Nguema and his cronies exercise full control over the hundreds of millions of dollars of oil money that flow into the country annually. Denis Sassou Nguessou of Congo does the same with his friends and so are Eduardo dos Santos of Angola and Joseph Kabila of DRC.
- Not letting myself get hungry throughout the day helped with not throwing up after every meal. I got sick more if I ate on a empty stomach. The best thing for me to eat was dried fruit. I tried fresh fruit and as much as I love it, it didn't make me feel like I ate anything but for some reason dried fruit did.
What I find disturbing living under a temperate weather where my clothes are mainly stored according to seasons is that when the weather reaches this transition time when the new season hasn't properly settled in yet, I seem to "forget" that I do have clothes for the coming season.
What can we do? We can't form a "skunkworks country" that can get around our laws and create a more mobile, productive society. We only have one option: we have to create a national process, like industries do, to become more "lean, mean and low to the ground". Get rid of superfluous laws. We simply must reduce the size of the CFR and reduce the destruction caused by the regulation and litigation in our society. To me, Tort Reform is absolutely essential. A big part of the industrial lean activities is to study what policies need to be gotten rid of because "we've always done it that way". The same should be done with the CFR.

You see we started obedience classes last week.

We had chosen a really cheap hostel because we didn’t want to spend a lot of money. It had been recommended to us by a friend at DIS, however.. I’m not sure WHAT they saw in the place, other than that the staff was really friendly. Here are my impressions: the neighborhood was incredibly sketchy (including a few corner stores, apartments, an erotic massage parlor, a hookah store and street lights only on one side of the street), the men (or should I say, boys) we encountered in the kitchen within an hour of arrival were self-righteous male chauvinists who thought that it was completely acceptable to be sloppily drunk by 22.00 and proceed to hit on anything with a mouth and boobs (it’s not acceptable ever, I don’t care if you’re european; those guys were disgusting), we were staying in a 5-bed mixed dorm with complete strangers, the room smelled like feet, and.. well.. the place wasn’t that clean. Definitely not the kind of place you really want to kick off your shoes and curl up in the blankets in – I slept on my credit cards and phone that night. At my request, we booked a private room ensuite for the following three nights, and I only had to stick it out one night in the slightly sketchy room (Maybe I’m spoiled, but I’d like to see you live in a place like that and not gag a few times).

A really-really-ugly long brown leather skirt showed up at our local thrift shop. I spent a whole dollar on it -- and I can only hope I didn't look too greedy as I snatched it up! Shortly after, my mother-in-law passed along an orange leather jacket that someone had passed along to her. It was a Coldwater Creek jacket in great shape -- can you imagine the guilt I felt as I cut it apart? *shiver* But it was a necessary sacrifice.

After the pie incident, and on the completion of all of the questioning, James Murdoch was asked at Q 413 by Mr Watson “When you signed off the Taylor payment, did you see or were you made aware of the full Neville email, the transcript of the hacked voicemail messages?” (The uncorrected transcript of proceedings is the source for these extracts ) (The Taylor payment refers to the settlement of a claim of phone hacking against the NotW by Gordon Taylor, head of the Professional Footballers’ Association, where James Murdoch authorised a payment of £700,000 including costs to conclude the matter. The “Neville” referred to was a former chief reporter for the NotW who received an email containing transcripts of many of Taylor’s phone conversations.)

I’m being honest here. You can decide whether it’s factual.
We've seen all this before in our history and we know that it was wrong. I think that in a lot of ways it still continues today. We have a lot of inequality of circumstance. People don't choose to be born one colour or another, they don't choose the religion that they grow up in and they don't choose their initial economic circumstances. It's therefore unfair to judge them or to oppress them based on the circumstances of their birth. The same applies to people on the spectrum and indeed all people who were born with conditions which differentiate them from "normality".

But something that you have to discuss and talk about is the relationship between House/Wilson. He said:
Ian MacKaye’s former group, Minor Threat, coined the term and eventual subcultural movement, Straight Edge; a lifestyle philosophy that abstains from the use of alcohol, drugs and promiscuous sex. These ideals are outlined lyrically in the Minor Threat tracks, Straight Edge and Out of Step (Khanna, 2007). This philosophy was carried on in the next MacKaye incarnation, Fugazi. Fugazi not only empowered these ideals but also insisted on only performing at venues that allowed entry to persons of all ages and walks of life. Singer/Guitarist Guy Picciotto stated in Our Band Could Be Your Lifethat “Everyone has to be able to come in. We don’t discriminate against people. If you were fourteen, you weren’t allowed to into a place to enjoy bands. So we just vowed in blood that we would never do the same thing to other kids” (Azerrad, 2001). No alcohol or drugs of any kind were to be consumed or sold at these performances. Fugazi were so adamant about their disassociation with these adult vices that any interviews of the group could not and would not be displayed in magazines that contained advertisements for alcohol and nicotine products (Azerrad, 2001). This gave the group an ageless aesthetic that everyone could relate to which provided a juxtaposed alternative to the sexed up hair metal and junkie crazed grunge bands during Fugazi’s active years. Along with these clean ideals was a punk DIY influence that infected their business practices and touring schedules. The rejection of selling any merchandise (clothing, items, albums etc) on tour meant their only focus was solely their live performances in which Fugazi have become infamous for keeping their entry price to $5. As the band grew in popularity and financial inflation increased, Fugazi stuck to this low concert fee (Khanna, 2007). All records were released through MacKaye’s own label, Dischord to avoid collaborating with any major label that may compromise the band’s brand, sound or ethics (Azerrad, 2001).
After this eventful afternoon, we had a small window of opportunity to walk around Old Town Alexandria and to visit a large wharf along the Potomac River. It was indeed a wonderful experience to soak up the beauty and history of the area. Our time in the area was capped off by a delicious send-off dinner at a lovely Italian restaurant. Our team is really gelling and well-focused for the mission that lies ahead in Zambia. We all look forward to a profound, life-changing experience.

Of course, I fell into the details of Chinatown like a person on a carb-restricted diet falls into a plate of pasta...and devours it!

It wasn't quite that narrow, from the standpoint of Europe. Even taking into account Bosnia/Serbia, Chechenya, and some of the anti-Soviet uprisings in the captive states total European casualties from 1945 until, well, now have been trivial compared to the cataclysms that engulfed the continent from 1914-1945. You are right though that the conflicts were essentially pushed out to the Third World.

Mtskheta was the main site of early Christian activities in Georgia and was the place where Christianity was proclaimed the state religion of the country in 337 AD, making them second only to Armenia in this regard. In the 6th century, the Jvari Monastery was built on top of a hill overlooking the rivers and Mtskheta and, in the 11th century, the Svetitskhoveli Cathedral was built in the middle of the old capital. Both of these religious structures are amongst the most significant monuments of Georgian Christian architecture and were among the “Historical Monuments of Mtskheta” as declared by the UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 1994. The city continued to serve as the coronation and burial place for most kings of Georgia until the end of the kingdom in the 19th century and it still remains the headquarters of the Georgian Orthodox and Apostolic Church to this day.

My mother, glowing and thrilled in a yellow silk dress last time, is now in a nursing home with dementia and did not attend. My stepmother, with whom I always had a tough relationship, has been dead for four years. My Dad, healthy and strong at 82, looked fab in a bow-tie and double-breasted navy blazer, his new partner Mary, in a saffron yellow silk jacket — just back from Hong Kong and the marriage of her daughter.

I've been writing about Compassion, recently. Feel free (again) to have a look at the websites and think about sponsoring a child yourself! I know of at least one other family that did so, after reading my previous post about Compassion. I'd love to hear from more people who are planning to! Or from people who already have a sponsor child!

For work we had a Halloween party and had to dress up as a movie character. I chose to be Alice from the Disney cartoon version of Alice in Wonderland. This costume was actually made on the evening of Sunday October 30th, the night before Halloween. I must say I am impressed that I finished this! For this costume I used McCall's 4948. Materials wise I used 4 yds of light blue moleskin that has been in my stash for years, 5.5 yds white Kona cotton, 3 yds 1.5" wide white satin ribbon, 6 yds of 1/2" horsehair braid and 1 22" blue zipper. I made a few changes to this pattern. First, I added a collar to the neckline since Alice's dress has one. I also added .5" in length to the bodice and took off 4" from the skirt length. I redrafted the back of the skirt using the pattern from the front so that the gathers would be more even throughout the dress. Lastly, I added a couple of layers of the cotton for and underskirt to match Alice's but also to give the dress a little more fullness. All layers of the skirt were then hemmed using the horsehair braid to give it the wavy look. I love this costume! So much so that I am kinda sad I will probably only wear it the one time.
Were they chosen for a reason? Are they guilty of some crime? Are they being punished? Are they dead? Is the Cube even real? The film doesn’t solve any of those questions; it may not even have any answers. Maybe the answers are all “maybe”. The filmmakers don’t even offer a cop out, but no one could expect an audience not to ask. Cube is, after all, a small-scale project with “low budget cult film” stamped all over it, a locked room murder mystery of sorts, granted its only scope by the ideas of inquiry.

The Tele Vue philosophy (Ethos, if you will) has always been about inspiring “spacewalk” vistas by creating the finest “rich field” refractors and wide angle eyepieces.

Try to think back to yesterday and see if you can recall everything you ate and drank. Every little taste, bite, snack, or sip that crossed your lips. Chances are you’d probably forget an item or two, and most likely underestimate what you consumed. That’s pretty normal in today’s society where we’re constantly eating on the go or dining with distractions. Seldom do we sit down at a table and spend 20-30 minutes solely focused on enjoying our meals without the T.V., computer, tablet, phone, or road diverting our attention.

After Googling a bit, I found some articles (here and here) that seemed to say that feminism actually benefits relationships. Because it creates a somewhat level playing field in the relationship where both partners could have some level of control. Each partner being able to act independently makes them a whole person, and they're able to bring that whole person to the relationship.
Significantly, discursive formations do not simply disappear from bodily movements, reflexes, and contagious transmissions. On the contrary, discourse is transmitted along with the prediscursive emergences of faces and stances. There is nonetheless an analytical requirement to map the changes in connectivities of prediscursive spaces and explore contemporary Tardean mediascapes, like the Internet, which as Thrift argues “act as new kinds of neural pathways . . . forging new reflexes.”(Thrift, Non-representational Theory, 236).

Children listen to me, “many of you are spending too much time watching television, you are spending too much time playing games, you must learn to work, the world is not a bed of roses, there is a lot of struggling going on and those who will work hard will make it to the top.

After several patents appeared online Nikon has officially revealed a new 28mm f/1.8, successor to the AI-S 28mm f/2.0 from 1981 (and a superb performer optically that was generally underrated because of the focal length). I used to have one and it was a better performer optically than either the AI-S 35mm f2.0 and even the vaunted 35mm f/1.4, which I also owned. It was left on a F2AS permanently in preference to those lenses but it couldn't matched by any other wide-angle in Nikon's range.

She was driving her way back to home. “I should let go. I should learn to let go. Why cant I accept the fact that I can loose something or someone?” She never realized when she took a wrong turn. She was now on the wrong way on a ONE WAY elliptical ramp. When she saw the huge truck coming right into her, she had only few seconds to react. She shouted as her car skid on the ramp border. The roaring horn of the truck alerted a cop patrolling nearby. Her car was upside down. The truck stopped and the driver called 911 for emergency. The cop switched on the police lights and blocked the ramp.

Mercifully, the rain held off on my walk south despite switching from bucketing to heavy all afternoon (and getting soaked at lunchtime in the process). I arrived and had a Crabbies whilst settling in to play the quiz machine (ended up breaking even). Joey arrived with a bag full of Hotel Chocolat treats and when added to my pastries, we must have had over 4,000 calories on the table at the very least. We had the usual catch up, ate burgers, pies and more pies. In total, nine people turned up so Yoshi’s Island was supported by Keira Knightley’s Stunt Thighs.

Upstairs are two artists’ studios. In one is a textile artist, creating hats, scarves and other items to be worn, while the other is home to an artist exploring drawing practices. It is always interesting to see behind the scenes, to see how people organise their work spaces and explore, develop and create art work. It was a pity they weren’t working, but it did give us an opportunity to snoop about.

1830 The Canterbury and Whitstable Railway (Kent) was opened. Sometimes referred to colloquially as the Crab and Winkle Line, it was the first steam hauled passenger railway to issue season tickets. It used cable haulage by stationary steam engines over much of its length, with steam locomotives restricted to the level stretch.
He knew that as developers made their way around the islands, shark habitat would continue to be whittled away. These big creatures were magnificent in their own right and vital to the naturally replenishing system that surrounded the coral. If the sharks went, so would the bountiful ecosystem that fed the locals and kept outsiders coming back to the islands to fish, to dive, to write, to dream.

Where do I even start with Caya (the baby - 6)? She was my hardest pregnancy, my unhappiest baby and the moodiest 6 yr old I've ever seen. She's my baby though. LOL Her favorite character is Tinkerbell, which suits her right to the ground. Super super cute and so sweet one minute and then screaming and throwing a tantrum the next. I don't know how many times I've heard her utter the words (whining & screaming) "I KNEW today wasn't going to be a good day!!!!!!!!!!!!", while I watch her storm into her bedroom.
Tenderhearted Southern girl, Anna Whitt, was born with the sixth sense to see and feel emotions of other people.

Of course, if you think about the state of the news-aggregating blogosphere, most of them are just spiking their punchlines with current events. Headlines being the punchlines in a link-don't-tell culture. So, you see, Hip Hop had a sense of integrity about page views and SEO before the internet even existed (in a popular, functional sense). That's why I like to tout blogging as the new rapping whenever I can. Cause just like all the real bloggers out there, and real rappers, and Common in this verse,

I closed the book to take another look at the cover, make sure I was reading the book I thought I was reading, and then went back to that last sentence. This is what I’ve been waiting for from the Orange Prize, I thought. In fact, it’s what I’m always waiting for in a novel—a tiny insight that makes you say yes, that’s exactly what it’s like.
I also quite strongly disagree with the idea that Mass Effect 3‘s position as being the last of a trilogy, and thus being in certain respect an ending in and of itself, somehow obviates the installment from conditions we might otherwise expect it to have. I’m afraid that is simply not the case, and the reason it is not the case is by its nature as an installment. While the underlying condition of a trilogy is indeed that each portion is part of an overarching narrative, they must also each have their own working parts; each unit must, in effect, duplicate the macrocosm on the microcosmic level. To put it in less fanciful terms – if one of the parts is busted the whole damn thing has problems.

And then, when my mouth´s all dry: the bedroom. ”And here´s the hobby room,” he says as we enter and his bed is a homemade composition of aluminum pipes dressed in black leather. ”The stuff scenographers use on stage,” he says, ”it´ll carry anything.” And I love him even more when he shows me the swing he´s made from seatbelts. The guy´s a stellar handyman and he´s got this ability to never lose focus on what´s important in life.

The importance of this trip is greater than the magnificent achievement of the actual crossing, it gives an insight into the ways that the first settlers of the islands may have thought; after all the problems of the voyage were the same regardless of the time period, nature in all her savage glory has no special concern for our personal advancement as a race, and will treat all humanity the same throughout the ages and the spaces of the world.
Obama has never said he wants a government-run health care system. He has said we have a moral duty to find ways to cover the nearly-50 million Americans who lack insurance and access to timely and inexpensive health care. He has said we pay too much (we spend $7,000 per capita for health care, way more than double any other nation — and we pay that for the 50 million people who don’t get health care, too). He has said we need to rein in health care cost inflation, which is double the rate of other goods and services, and which was a major factor in crippling American auto companies competing against foreign producers whose governments offer health coverage for all citizens including auto workers.

Those of you who have been part of our community here for a few months will remember that this Cathedral is a new building. Our original building was something of an icon, having pushed the boundaries of building techniques in its time and won an award for SL architecture. Monty Merlin did a truly superb job in creating it. Though it was becoming a little dated in looks, the Cathedral still drew many to visit it, Christians and non-Christians. It was therefore with some trepidation that the attempt was made to create a new design. For many months Cady laboured and others commented, both the Leadership Team and as many of the community as were prepared to take a look. We even had a RL architect look it over!
Bing Crosby does a wonderful version of it in “The Bells of St. Mary.” As a kid I sang it in church. In Latin, which was never a problem, so why must it be in this day and age?

They have been known to trade their early draft picks or prospects for old, star players whose level of play has severely declined. Trades like Adam Mair and a second rounder that would turn into Mike Cammalleri to Los Angeles for Aki Berg and Brad Boyes, Alyn McCauley and a first round pick to San Jose for Owen Nolan, goaltending phenom Tuukka Rask to Boston for Andrew Raycroft and possibly the most infamous; two first round picks that would turn into Tyler Seguin, Dougie Hamilton, and a second rounder that would turn into Jared Knight to Boston for Phil Kessel. Mention of any of these trades make Leafs fans flinch, and for good reason.

His owners graciously allowed me to photograph him; Henry was obviously comfortable in front of the camera as every shot of him was perfect, all ready for a painting.

Even though I don’t judge someone personally or cast judgement upon them, the Truth IS sharper than any sword and judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart. God’s Truth IS the Truth, speaks nothing but the Truth, and judges on it’s own. I will always make sure that I am not being judgmental. But this has also taught me that God’s word will convict, because Truth and Spirit will act in ways that I have no control over. It’s control I personally don’t want anyway! Let that be God’s working in lives!

The early scenes of the film give the background for Esther’s desperate bid to make it in Hollywood , showing her in a suffocating small-town household, with a bullying aunt who ridicules her dreams of becoming an actress. This feels similar to the claustrophobic family setting in Small Town Girl. It is only too easy to see why she accepts some money from Granny (May Robson) and heads off to the bright lights. Eleven writers were involved in creating the A Star Is Born screenplay, including Dorothy Parker and Ben Hecht - whose wit adds to the sparkling dialogue. But, nevertheless, the film definitely has Wellman’s stamp on it, and this whole small-town sequence feels very characteristic of him.

From a strictly drinks perspective, the Tiki Lounge can't compete with some of the internationally known big boys of tikidom or even some of the bars in town like Prescription or Curio who occasionally feature a tiki option on menu and have the range of rums and necessary ingredients to pull them off with aplomb. But for nightcrawlers seeking the whole tiki experience – deco and all - this is currently the only place in town to get it. It may be just baby steps, but it is a valid start to the tiki trend in Paris.

This figurative truth becomes clearly evident in watching the tides of mankind and the manner in which we hope for these tides or trends to fill the hole. There is always purpose to man’s comings and his goings; the ebb and the flow. We are always striving to improve our lot in life; to fill the void, avoid the ebb, and normalize the flow – increase our vocabulary, trade up the car, start a revolution, make a better impression, identify the inner-child, have whiter teeth, more colorful hair, better wages, more vacation, etc., ad infinitum. Our drive, or purpose, is certainly to fill an unseen hole; to make things better. The metanarrative of our life may even be, quite simply, that we try to fill the hole. It’s what we do. It’s the condition that we’re born with.
RoTP‘s narrator is an interesting paradox of experiences because he explores the ideas of loving-kindness and mindful presence while he himself becomes embroiled in his own emotions, anxieties, and obsessions, which, in turn, remove him from the experience. I just find it interesting that these minor themes come up and that fiction continues to be a great place to expand our understanding of ourselves and the world around us.
To argue that the Creation story privileges a heterosexual view of the relations between humankind is to make one of the weakest arguments possible: the argument from silence. An argument from silence is no argument at all. The Creation story is indeed about Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve, as critics of homosexuality like to admonish. But though heterosexuality may be the dominant form of sexuality, it does not follow that it is the only form of appropriate sexuality.

Levin said the developer plans affordable housing, though he wouldn't guarantee it would be included at that site. The firm would participate in the 80/20 program, gaining tax breaks for making 20% of the units are subsidized and thus affordable or buying certificates that ensure that affordable housing gets built elsewhere in the city. Skeptical audience members suggested that the latter tactic would be far more likely.

The traditional Easter bunnies are not found in France. In a marked deviation from Easter festivities elsewhere, Easter celebrations in France incorporate the Easter symbols of bells and fish. The French Easter fish are called ‘Poisson d’Avril’, which means ‘April Fish’. The Poisson d’Avril makes his appearance on the 1st of April, as French children delight in playing a kind of ‘April Fool’s’ trick. They stick a paper fish onto the back of as many adults as possible.

"Do you want butter one them?" She asked every Saturday morning, even though the answer never changed. Michael grunted, and she put on the butter. Just as she always had, she walked them over to the table and set his down in front of him, and then walked with hers to her seat at the table. "Michael." His head snapped up from his plate to see her smiling there, "I know what you did to me." His stomach went empty, and he could feel the blood leave his face. She took a bite of pancake, chewed slowly, never losing her smile or eye contact, swallowed, and then finished her thought, "It wasn't very nice of you. All I wanted was a picture hung." His throat got dry, and her smile got bigger, "I promise I'll never ask you to do that again." Finally he was able to swallow, but could now see what he figured to be all of her teeth, "But I can promise one more thing, Buddy: I'm never leaving."

Much as we both enjoyed The Deep but it wasn't quite as 'Wow!' as we were expecting and we both agreed that actually we prefer the Sea Life Centre in Scarborough and felt that it had more to offer. The Deep is still worth a visit, but if you had to choose one aquarium to visit, there would be no contest for us.
And a few other personal friends are also getting invisalign there! :D
The rest of the run looks like this: Bell's Double Cream Stout (yes, a firkin of that!) next week, Heavy Seas Below Decks Barley Wine the week after (1/27). If you were wondering how the distributor is going to make it up to us for delivering the wrong cask, then taking it back, I will tell you: A firkin of Bell's Hopslam. Yep. I will let you know when we plan on getting into that. It may go before the Below Decks, but I want to see it before I make any solid commitments to you folks. Expect a stampede of beer lovers when we tap the Hopslam.
I served this with a spinach side salad that complimented the flavors of the fish.
"Anne Eliza was surrounded by 'cultured' women, and she described her home as a 'literary center.' Her aunts contributed to magazines like Godey’s Ladies Book and The Ladies Repository. Poet and editor (The New World) Park Benjamin was a guest, as was writer and editor (The Home Journal ,which became Town & Country) N.P. Willis. Willis’s sister, Fanny Fern — novelist, essayist and children’s story writer — also visited often. Anne Eliza was acquainted with literary figures like Catherine Sedgwick, Washington Irving and William Cullen Bryant."Anne Eliza left Brooklyn soon after her own education was finished and eventually married and settled in Ohio.

“All the rage – the dernier cri: How can we joyfully subvert the latest hype? And what happens when the phrase is taken literally? Images of war and revolution emerge before the mind’s eye, but also the global emblems of the financial crises and the occupy movement. The ‘latest’ cry is also the final one, the end – which in turn gives rise to a new beginning. In the interstice between we look for: new positions and unexpected approaches.” (Andalus/Dada, Artistic directors)

Now remove the top of the shortcake and spoon about a half cup of the strawberries and juices onto the bottom of the cake. Top those berries with a big dollop of whipped cream. Place the top on the shortcake, and add another half cup of sliced strawberries, another smaller dollop of whipped cream and garnish the top each with a strawberry, and serve. Enjoy!
This changed the mood of the people watching the exchange, and they started to ask more questions. “Is there even any food to be had? Or is this just a scam?”

The costume direction (by Jill Ohannesson) is just fine, sometimes boring, except for Nolan (see examples of his outfits here), who is the Hamptons version of Chuck Bass, extremely preppy and bold; and Ashley, played by Ashley Madekwe. Both are the most interesting characters of the series, in terms of fashion.

The boycott’s best-known feature was the prohibition of direct trade between Israel and the Arab countries; but this in fact was the least harmful of its provisions. The blackballing of companies that merely dealt with companies doing business with Israel enlarged the circle of hatred to immense proportions (Pepsi, among others, participated in the boycott).
Before I get into this, have any of you seen GCB? It is hilarious! I just love Annie Potts anyway, and the rest of the cast is great, too. Kristen Chenoweth, especially. I've never seen David James Elliott in a role like this, and he does it so well. They play a married couple and spout Christian platitudes and quote Bible verses while having wild monkey sex all over the house. So so funny! I wasn't familiar with Leslie Bibb before this show, and don't know the others on there, but it's a good cast. Super rich Baptist Texan Republicans. What's not to like? LOL Hope you're watching it and like it, too. Lots of criticism from Christians about the hypocrisy in these comments HERE. (smirk) Sorry, but I know too many people like that around here to dismiss it. Besides, it's supposed to be funny and is.

Misfits & Heroes: West from Africa, by Kathleen Flanagan Rollins, takes place around 12,000 BC, and as you may have guessed, starts off in Africa. Naaba is an outcast from his village and a wanderer. It has been a long time since he's been part of a village, so when he comes upon one, he is drawn to it and watches a weaver at her work. While in this village, however, he finds Asha, a woman being held captive, and he frees her. She is drawn to water, and follows it even when it cannot be seen, and she decides to join Naaba in his wandering, so that she may follow the water without being punished.

You don’t see cherry and gin flavours together very often, but this really did work well. The non-sugary cherry juice, combined with the zestiness of the lime, ensures that the drink has a pleasant crispness. It is the gin, however, that provides the accompanying clean finish. Simple, but delicious.
The fall came and I found myself wanting a pair of socks for myself. Picking a fun purple colorway I cast on and worked on the sock for months. (In my off time, which was increasingly disappearing.) I carried them with me to knit on the train or bus, to knit in between classes, and during my crafting group. I finally finished them a few weeks before Christmas. The were rather loose, which was disappointing to realize. I wore them none the less, in love with the fact that I made a sock. Unfortunately they were lost among some clothing items and were felted in the wash. During the sock challenge, I decided it was time I tackled cables. Having made a sock, and mittens, and a sweater, I wanted to tackle this. Using a basic cable pattern, I ended up making a green scarf that was soft, and beautiful and fun. I loved cables, I still do, I love the texture, the look, the act of knitting them. They keep knitting interesting, but are something I feel I could do while watching t.v.

I'm knitting this in some Dale of Norway Svale, which I liberated from Mom's stash last year. There wasn't enough of it to make a sweater, so this seems like the perfect use. It's a DK (so warm and quick!) cotton/silk/viscose blend. It's one of the splitty-est yarns I've ever worked with. But, the silk makes it so soft and gives it beautiful drape, so I'm willing to forgive it.

If by any chance you haven't heard about this book, it's the first in a new series of four books about King Arthur's daughter Rhianna Pendragon and her friends Prince Elphin, Cai and Arianrhod. There are battles, knights, dragons, and a sword or two - though you won't find yourself sliding about in gore on every page. There's also a telepathic horse called Alba, a talking merlin, and quite a bit of magic.

Yay Mimi and thank you so much.
She's really starting to look like a toddler too... her face has matured so much in these last several months and her hair has grown tremendously. She now has 12 teeth and her feet have FINALLY started growing (she's been in a size 0-3 month shoe for the longest time and now she's in a 3-6 month!) And for even more exciting news... she took her first steps last night! Granted she only took two steps and they were quite wobbly, but still, that's massive progress! What was she walking towards? Her ginormous panda bear, JoJo. She loves him. Hopefully there will be many more steps in her near future.

We appreciated your video a lot because it answered a purchasing decision question for us "visually"...and a picture is worth 1,000 words!!! We already knew we wanted to purchase a FURminator for our 2 large dogs (lab/retriever mix) based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews we had read, including yours, but we were still debating on whether or not to get the model with the FURejector. In your video it is clear how easily and effectively this feature "ejects" the fur from the brush - in fact we can even hear a distinct click sound when you press the release button and then see how all the bunched fur is free to drop in the trash. Looks worth it to us so we'll be ordering the exact model you used in your video (same size, too). Thanks for the help with our decision!

Yesterday I wrote about how I was planning on making some changes in my classroom. Today I wanted to give a quick follow-up on how those changes were received.
The use of banker's check decreased after the introduction of the KRW 50,000 note in 2009, but until then, it was a common sight for the KRW 100,000 banker's check to get whipped out, usually with the same gusto that an American might pull out a $100 bill.
What does this all mean for broken windows, urban governance, and crime today? The problems of New York and the Bronx in particular in the 1980s were not radically different from those of St. Louis in the 1960s. The city was struggling, losing tax revenues, jobs, and population. Young people responded to an atmosphere of hopelessness by joining gangs, tagging walls, and inventing hip-hop. While Jeff Chang may lionize the gangs too much in his history, deemphasizing the real harm they did to themselves and their communities, they did represent one reaction to a crisis of drugs, violence, and general disorder that plagued the Bronx. That same frustration could also be channeled into art and music, as an outlet for creativity and as a kind of protest against authorities who seemed indifferent or even malignant.
Alas, if tonight was a glamorous night on the town with the love of my life, this is the outfit I'd be wearing. That beautiful bling would be a bonus outcome if it were to arrive on my left hand at the end of the night...

The situation in the camp is devastating, and most women, young girls and children are walking around naked and barefooted. Some of the girls can’t even go to school because they don’t have clothes. The worst thing however, is pregnant women delivering their babies under trees in extreme weather with no shelter. This puts both the mother and child at risk. To make matters worse, children and newborns are severely affected by the shortage of food, resulting in high malnutrition rates.

To improve the health situation in the country, it is established that there should be improvement in the training of healthcare providers; and there should be increased allocation for health to 15% of the total budget in line with WHO recommendations, while 10% is to be devoted to maternal and childcare. The media should also be used to advance the cause of maternal health programmes in Nigeria because ignorance is responsible for spreading diseases, and such enlightenment campaigns should not be limited to the issue of HIV/AIDS and cancer afflictions. It is also true that State Primary Health Development Agencies must be established in all local government areas of Nigeria; while functional health facilities with trained staff should be provided, as well as an integrated supervision system for healthcare centres. There should be improved referral system, to enhance good record keeping of statistics, and there should be improvement of girl-child education while there should be free Medicare for children, pregnant women and the aged. In the words of Saleh Mohammed again, “There should be attention paid to International Donor Partners (IDP) programmes and signing of MOU with foreign medical experts to provide HITECH Medical Services in the states of the federation”, he concluded.

The sentiment comes from a MFT Birthday set. I made the card for Memories and More where I am working now.

. . . A claim of dilution applies only to purely commercial speech. Mattel, 353 F.3d at 812. See also Bolger, 463 U.S. at 66-67 (finding that materials do not become “commercial speech” simply because the author had economic motivation to create them). “The question whether an economic motive existed is more than a question whether there was an economic incentive for the speaker to make the speech; the Bolger test also requires that the speaker acted substantially out of economic motivation.” Procter & Gamble Co. v. Amway Corp., 242 F.3d 539, 552-53 (5th Cir. 2001) (emphasis supplied). “Thus, for example, speech that is principally based on religious or political convictions, but which may also benefit the speaker economically, would fall short of the requirement that the speech was economically motivated” and therefore would be considered noncommercial.

In Part I of Demeter’s Love, I introduced a number of elements to the reader. They are threads which will be picked up, worked into a fabric and woven together again. That, in and of itself, is a reversal of the singular masculine, left-brain activity of constructing a linear narrative and sticking to it. We all know our high school education, which stressed and trained us in the superiority of, and adherence to, the expository essay. The linear drill goes like this: first, make your statement, then provide all supporting evidence to prove that statement, then make one’s concluding statements. All wrapped up in a neat package. That is, indeed, a true reflection of the left brain view of the world. It works, however, for only one half of the brain. Unfortunately, the creative yin does not obey those rules of verbal and written expression. This is exactly why her part of the symbology is depicted as black – it is difficult to perceive her hidden wisdoms and it requires the cultivation of our impressionistic visionary abilities to follow her.
1) Each player gets: 10 Statement Cards, 5 True/False Cards and, 2 Negation Chips. You will be choosing cards to play on each turn, so it’s ok to look at all the cards in your hand.

The first race saw favourite Star in Flight romp home under Jason Maguire – winning by a margin which showed the 4 year old is set for good things in the future. There is no doubt that the ground – good to soft, although more soft looking, showed those horses who had stamina and fitness to cope with the conditions. Margins of 8 lengths, with the third horses over 20 lengths behind that on three occasions either flattered the winners or showed poor preparation of the others. In fairness, there were a number of maidens and novices on show in what was a fairly competitive card.
I decided to go with roast. Jamie Oliver's book Jamie's Italy had a method for roasting quails. Granted he suggested covering them with pancetta, which I didn't do, and it probably would have moistened the meat a bit more. I did rest them on a bed of fresh herbs as Jamie suggested though. I went out on my balcony to pick the thyme and rosemary. It was a horrific, rainy, chilly night and the 30 seconds I spent out there cutting herbs was torture. The things I do to feed my family!
Okay -- so there's not time or room enough to highlight everyone in one post. I have learned something though. Everyone is a character. We just need to look and listen and and pay attention to them. What makes them interesting? What is it about this person that makes me want to smile when I am around them? Why does the hair on my arms stand up when I stand next to that person? How can I create characters in my stories that create these kinds of emotions for my readers? What do you do? Do you base your characters on people you know?

He approached the table at Wildfire in Schaumburg and sang, “When the moon meets the sky like a big apple pie that’s…” He pretended to hold a microphone and encouraged me to sing in response and so I did: “Amore.” I would like to publicly extend an apology for those diners who had to endure my off pitch musical response.
All in all, Spire Publishing is clear and concise about their services. The Print Ready Plus package seems to offer the best deal provided the author can supply their own files.

To make it work, the parent company sets up a third subsidiary (S3) in the Netherlands, with no other purpose than to funnel money from S2 to S1. Instead of licensing the parent’s products directly to S2, the Bermuda-based S1 grants them to its Dutch partner, who then passes them along. In other words, S1 and S2 are the bread around an S3 Dutch meat sandwich. What good is that? The Irish don’t tax money being moved among European countries (S2 to S3), and the Netherlands takes only a small fee for moving the money from S3 to S1. This makes it so the “royalties” checks can arrive in Bermuda virtually untaxed.

The more mature we are when we enter a relationship, the more likely we are to succeed in finding the harmony we desire. In general, we attract persons who correspond to our present stage of interests, motives, values, goals, etc. This occurs through the attraction of similar or opposites. As we ourselves mature and become more aligned to our true selves, we will attract people who are aligned to our true selves.
Targeted strikes are wise. Remotely piloted aircraft in particular can be a wise choice because of geography, with their ability to fly hundreds of miles over the most treacherous terrain, strike their targets with astonishing precision, and then return to base. They can be a wise choice because of time, when windows of opportunity can close quickly and there may be just minutes to act.

Here is how I colored him for my final picture. Since I didn't want to switch paper, I changed my technique instead. I decided to go with feather blending. I am working with the Natural Blending Group of R24, R29 and R59. Since R29 is the darkest in the R20's group, then I can shadow it with either R39 or even darker, R59. Since I like more contrast, I went with R59.

This month our budget has to be super tight if we're gonna stay on track with our savings because in Feb the car insurance, 2 new tyres and a few other one-off bills all came out at once, don't you hate that? At least they're done for the year now.
Mason said his distinct Jewish sense of humour often alienated members of that community. He said: ‘A lot of Jews are embarrassed by Jewishness because it reminds them of their parents and grandparents who were refugees and poverty stricken. They were always like an alienated minority. People who are raised that way still have a feeling of “I don’t belong if I’m Jewish so I’d rather you don’t mention it”.’

A Scouser is an individual from Liverpool. Scousers are notoriously maligned and stereotyped by everyone else in the UK. This is because they are jealous. Our immigrant population ensures that there is an excellent gene-pool, thus avoiding the horrific inbreeding seen in the majority of incest-rife no-mark cities of the UK. Scousers hate the English – because we are not English we are Scouse. As a scouser I can trace my lineage back to the Kings of Ireland. Mancs (for example) can only trace their lineage back 20 years to when their dads arse-raped a sheep, hence the wool on their greasy backs.
The really nice thing about this surgery is that we aren’t far away from support (i.e. the middle of the Pacific Ocean). We are just up in Milwaukee, so we have plenty of friends and family who have made plans to be there for us in whatever capacity we need. I am so appreciative. I feel bad because I have no idea what to tell people when they ask, “how can I help?” because I don’t know what our days in the hospital are going to look like yet, but the simple fact that they have made themselves available to us is an immense comfort. So, thank you, everyone. Sincerely. Mahalo nui loa.
“THE CURSE OF FENRIC” – Season 26, Serial 3, Story 155 – The Seventh Doctor and Ace head back to World War II and do a slow burn to brilliance. The TARDIS sets down in a northern English coastal village where the Brits are codebreaking German messages with the ULTIMA machine. There’s evil in the air and evil in the water as an ancient Viking curse comes to the surface. There’s British soldiers and Russian soldiers and Haemovores all killing each other. There’s Fenric and the Ancient One, plotting and swerving. There’s the Doctor reducing his Companion to tears. And there’s Ace, little girl lost and manipulated and coming into her own, physically and figuratively caught between her past and her future as she becomes one of the most important Companions in the program’s history. This is classic Who’s penultimate serial and instead of the series crumbling away it’s building a blueprint for the future. Because The Curse of Fenric Is The First Serial of the 2005 Revival. Believe It.

The Zimmerman-Martin case revealed how sharply divided whites and blacks in America still are since the signing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. While strides have been made in the nearly fifty years since then to ensure equality before the law, a relative minority of the black community, some 13% of the U.S. population, has demonstrated progress. By almost any measurement of social disfunction African Americans lead all other races in America.

Hiya Folks
My blog has always been just a place to write. I'm very fortunate in that I have a great day job and that blogging can be purely a hobby. I have no need or desire to make money out of it. But we bloggers are apparently "new media". We are influential in our little spheres. I have personally checked out products recommended by other bloggers, even purchased things, so I can see how this is changing the marketing world. Last week I got my first invitation to a press event. It was for a local children's clothing company, one which happened to have been started right in my own neighborhood, and one that I already know and love.
I’m always a little concerned about earthquakes, and even lorries driving along my street, as I live in an old building, with huge and old cracks throughout, and very little mortar between the bricks, but I was assured that this was all old earthquake damage and subsidence and specialists had confirmed that the house was now stood on bedrock and wouldn’t move more. But still, I’m always cautious! In fact, I’m actually more worried about the combination of thunder, heavy rain, and earthquake at the moment, as its been very hot, and we have had lots of sudden downpours, which lead to temporary flooding. I checked the house and the cracks in the building and nothing seems to have moved, but I have developed a leek in the kitchen roof. There are lots of signs of leaks in the past, and roofs are generally just tin slates and not always great quality, many are old and have only been patched up. I’ve been surprised not to have experienced more leaks, so this is the first and is in the position of an older one. Its not bad, just a few big drips and I hope that once this few weeks of storms passes, life will get back to usual.

I've chosen one of my surprisingly enigmatic drawings for you all. This was a simple drawing I did of an adorable little donkey at my local Zoo, which surprisingly draws in people more than any other drawing I've done. I cannot figure out why, but people just love this little guy. The title, "Nobility Hath no Shape" came about because I always have had a soft spot for donkeys, even if they are not considered as sleek as horses.

There's something about this time of year that makes me want to watch more film-noir. It's strange because when it comes to noir, I'm a pretty light-weight viewer, but I've already seen two in the last week and I'm craving more. There's just something about the moody photography and sharp dialogue that fits so perfectly with a cold winter night and a mug of hot chocolate.

Abstract: Although Indigenous people in the poorest developing countries of the world confront the most severe hardships, nevertheless even in the most developed countries such as Australia, Indigenous standards of living in terms of economic, educational and basic human standards are far inferior to other groups within society. It has been argued that Indigenous affairs in Australia is divided into ‘‘two ideological tribes’’ both vigorously opposed with respect to the preferred manner in which the substantial disadvantage of Indigenous Australians can be overcome. Although more complex categorisations of ideological positions are possible, both maintain considerable influence within the field of Indigenous policy formulation in Australia and in the Northern Territory in particular, where nearly 30 per cent of the total population is Indigenous. The main purpose of this paper is to examine the central arguments advanced by these two sides of the debate and the implications for public policy decision making and Indigenous people, within the context of the Northern Territory of Australia.

1. Give up your need to always be right. There are so many of us who can’t stand the idea of being wrong – wanting to always be right – even at the risk of ending great relationships or causing a great deal of stress and pain, for us and for others. It’s just not worth it. Whenever you feel the ‘urgent’ need to jump into a fight over who is right and who is wrong, ask yourself this question: “Would I rather be right, or would I rather be kind?” Wayne Dyer. What difference will that make? Is your ego really that big?

Do homebrewers have any such titles or rankings? Not at all. Aside from being no more than a pastime, homebrewing is a much more egalitarian activity. Even award-winning, long-time homebrewers still make mistakes and are still learning about their devoted weekend diversion. There is much more camaraderie and less status among homebrewers, as the hobby lends itself to teaching and learning across both the novice and the expert.
You taught me so many lessons in life, without even realizing you were teaching. You taught me that it doesn't matter how rich your bank account is, what's important is how rich your life is. You worked your entire life for very little. While you may not have had a million dollars in the bank, when it came to life and love, you were a millionaire 10 times over. You taught me that pride isn't about what you own, but where you come from.

The peditrician and I heard a baby crying. The baby was outside with her mother waiting for their turn to past. However, the baby was not crying out of exhaustion, she was crying because she was hungry. The mother refused to breastfeed her child because she did not want her breast to drop, supposedly she wanted her breast to stay fresh and perky. Hmm…she needs to understand that your breast are not longer yours once you have a child.

The story is fairly simple if you take it at face value. Three boys mysteriously get special powers and start to control and grow them. The fun ends when one of the boys starts to go rogue, which leads to a climax that pits the friends against each other. It’s only when the movie begins that you forget about what you know about the movie from the previews and become immersed in a sad tale of a boy trapped in a desolate and hopeless world. The movie revolves around Andrew (brilliantly played by Dane DeHaan) who has the camera in which most of the film is filmed with. Andrew is a likable guy with some major family problems but he doesn’t let that hurt his disposition as he buys a camera and decides to “chronicle” his life. He doesn’t have many friends and is sort of a loner. It isn’t until him and two others (Matt and Steve) stumble upon a mysterious hole and are given powers that he starts to enjoy the life he films. The first 45 minutes or so are sort of a whimsical experience as the boys challenge their limits and become acquainted with their new powers. The first half of the movie is fun not because of the powers on display but because of the people who display them. Dane DeHaan, Alex Russell, and Michael B. Jordan are excellent young talents and with lesser actors, Chronicle would have probably been a one trick pony.

Please allow me to introduce myself. I am a transplant. I was plucked roots and all from fertile ground in a land of brilliant sunshine and nourishing rain and deposited in frozen tundra, a vast wasteland of crumbling buildings and uncaring souls. For years I withered and railed against the harshness of the terrain. I longed for the warmth of my homeland. I longed for beauty and kindness.
Last up this week is Kimberly Crawford. Kimberly is using the Autumn Flourishes set. For the stamp mist technique challenge, Kim chose to create die cut leaf accents which actually become the focal image in the arrangement. The technique is done the same...ink, mist, stamp, but afterwards, Kim cut out the shapes, added some sponge coloring and color misting, then darkened the edges for an added effect. Love the colors, the design elements, and details!!! Wonderfully done, Kim!
A Traveller in Italy by H V Morton, not actually found in the library but given to me recently by my old college professor - a happy coincidence given that we are planning our own travels in Italy - is a such a pleasure to read. I cannot say travel writing is a genre that has heretofore particularly interested me but I can see me reaching for more of Morton's books, especially those about Rome. The Fountains of Rome was a darn good read if a little too heavy (physically) for bedtime reading.

No matter what he does in any film, Lee always knows how to make everything pretty. He uses a lot of different lenses that add this dirty and gritty feel but he’s also able to change it up at any moment and place us in a different time and place. Once again, Lee is just playing around with his certain camera tricks and is seeing what he can and can not do, but it still works all of the same and makes Lee the wonder he is usually known as. Well, that is when it comes to his art-direction.

To provide an example: My "A" topic will be my regular Thursday debate using the topic of April Fool's Day. On Friday when I often write about mysteries I will be talking about Babylon. On Saturday I always have a review of my past week's posts and the upcoming posts so on April 3 my topic will be Capsulization. I will resume the challenge on Monday with one of my Persnickety Penman installments-- D as in Dictionary. See how easy it is. I don't really have to change my format of what I normally write, just come up with topics that correspond with the letter of the day. I printed out a calendar grid for the month of April and x'ed out the Sundays and wrote the letters in each of the daily squares. In less than an hour I came up with all of my topics for each letter. And I can still change them if I want---I probably will change some. It was fun just filling in the 26 topics and imagining the possibilities.

AUTUMN in Wellington tends to arrive first with a thud in the form of an icy southerly front followed by a relapse into ‘Indian summer’ and then an inevitable descent into winter. Unlike the majority of the population I relish autumn as it marks the start of the cooler months which I far prefer to the muggy heat of summer and the windy fury of spring.
Even from a fandom perspective, there’s something satisfying about having a canonical paratext, so to speak. Even when fandom breaks definitively from the authorized accounts of the show it benefits from having them there to frame and shape the conversation. Fandom necessarily assumes a paratext to the show, and having at least some common ground in that paratext makes all of this much simpler.
To that end, I purchased what is referred to as a "park model" - a small, one bedroom, single wide manufactured home that is anchored to the desert.

But as the plane started to fly high with a sudden increase of pressure, the boy now started to shriek. He cried and cried, stopping only once in a while to suck the bottle intermittently. No one or nothing can stop him from crying now—his father and mother’s alternating hugs, massaging his back, stroking his hair, standing up and walking around while holding the baby. None of this worked. Many passengers who were near enough to hear this baby shriek started to fumble about with their bodies and made nasty faces. I was one of them. I kept making ugly faces for the next thirteen hours, until the plane landed at LAX.

Ally Condie's Matched was one of the hyped releases at BEA. I was able to hear her speak on the YA panel, and was so impressed by her. She's the kind of person I think I could be friends with, but more importantly to this work, she gets teens, in spite of the fact that she knows she's not one of them -- a hopelessly uncool adult -- because she's a high school teacher, and she remembers what it's like to be a teenager herself.

Furthermore, as Craig goes on to make clear, even if the intention is simultaneous with the event that it causes, this does not mean that it is not *causally* or *explanatorily* prior to the event: the man’s intention to hold onto the tree-branch is what explains his holding onto the tree branch, not the other way around. I see this as a “the dog wags the tail, the tail doesn’t wag the dog”-kind of point.

So, about the lady. She was, hmmmm....maybe mid-forties, sandy blonde hair cut into a longish bob (hard to tell, cuz I think she had taken out some of her paint color issues on her locks), glasses, a black shirt, and, well, that's about all I remember. Does this really matter? No. Just thought you'd like to create her character in your head to make the story more interesting.
-Isaac was actually born with an imperforate anus, which just means that his little bottom hole isn't there. So that was kinda shocking, but actually made sense with some of the ultrasounds that we had seen problems with his bowels in. That was surgery number one, & it went really well, but because all of his tummy area is kind of tender right now so they're not wanting to route any tubes down there just yet - hence the VAD. So back to the bowel stuff - right now they have just re-routed everything temporarily to a little sack on the outside of his tummy, but in the next few months they'll do another surgery & then another or two over time & can get everything all fixed up for him & working. It apparently isn't a super uncommon thing...& surgery went really well it seems like. We're still waiting to make sure everything healed up & is working as it should - but it sounds like it all went really well!There could have been a lot more complications with his kidneys, bowels & intestines, but all of those are looking okay :)

For many people the only association they have with the town is it features in Bram Stoker’s “Dracula”, and the ruined abbey up on the hill definitely has a suitably atmospheric look to it. Needless to say there’s a certain amount of cashing in on the attendant tourism, and I don’t think I’ve seen so many shops in one town where you can buy Gothic clothing and paraphernalia.
However, if you are looking for sturdy shoes that are good for walking then opt for the Pursuit from Stacy Adams. It is available in a grey suede colour. It is a 2-eyelet casual ankle boot that comes with a padded collar. The non-leather sole and suede upper gives it a distinctive look.

The reason why I’m writing this post is because an old acquaintance from a forum I used to participate in wrote to me and asked me how my relationship was going. I laughed and wrote back, “It went!” She seemed sadder than I was about it- we were 2 out of 5 women on a forum where everyone thought we would end up with our affair partner. My acquaintance is now married to her partner, and the other three are either married or living together. I am the only one who isn’t still with their partner, which is one of the reasons why I haven’t been on that forum in a long time. While some of the reason is because I’m slightly embarrassed at how much I defended we were “different” (and other members agreed with me), the other reason is because it’s painful to be on there and hear about how happy the other four women are…clearly, they were right that their situation was unique, and clearly, mine was not. There were over 50 women on that forum, so our 5 “unique” affair relationships stood out.

I went to work two weeks following my high school graduation. (I had worked part-time gigs in high school, but it was now time for the big leagues.) I was hired by an insurance company and it was an amazing job. I got to sort mail and push a cart down long dark hallways and deliver the mail to different offices. The office was located in San Francisco's financial district. It was really fun, challenging and great for the first week, then I got the cart and my hand stuck somehow in an elevator door. I went home early because of my bruised hand.

I love writing. It's the one way that I can be totally me! Sometimes people misunderstand the things that I say, but when writing, it all seems to come out and clear and totally together. I am note a blogger by day, but rather one by night. By day I work in the medical field. I have had the honor of being published in a few of my medical journals, as well as being featured in the Proverbs 31 Ministries magazine.
Liisa McCloy Kelly from Random House said that making an EPUB before EPUB 3 was “like waltzing with both hands tied behind your back and a weight on one foot.” (I think of it more as Tarantella in the dark while the stage shifts constantly underfoot) She said that Random House has 5 different eBook processes, the most complex of which requires teams of product managers, HTML coders, designers, R&D and testing. She recommends encouraging designers to keep an eye on digital conversion, to think about variable sizes.

If one consciously understands their personal thinking style, and is able to recognize such things as negative self-talk and counter-productive behaviors, they are well on the way to affecting their mindset. Similar to learning, practice and repetition will enable and adjust the thought process. In time, the conscious re-framing, positive self-talk, and awareness becomes the new mindset.

Apparantly keeping with the water theme. Huge white head this time, cloudy again but with a more orange look to it. No clue what hop I'm smelling here, but it smells like (I'm sorry), kind of a dumpster outside a restaurant, that eerie sweet smell. Taste of the beer is not bad, strong hops, low malt, something I would like if I were on my Extra IPA kick. With this weather though I'm nearly ready for Bock season. The hops on this one are pretty tough for me, probably a big amount of American and German hops. I don't taste the apricots they say are in there. High 2 Stars.

I made a 3t in blue and an 18-24 mo. in gray. I found the fabric at Joann's, it's just a plain old quilting cotton, but I thought the print was cute. Both dresses have the same matching blue buttons. I wanted to put gray buttons on the blue dress but I couldn't find any that coordinated with the gray fabric. Oh well, they are still cute and the pattern was very easy. I can't wait to see the girls wearing them on Easter.

That book is about how control destroys a relationship. If a parent is abusive, the book can still help, but seriously the best advice for you if you are abusive is to GET SOME HELP! Stop abusing your kids, stop yelling at them, stop hitting them, give them a voice that isn't yours. Abusers have a way of taking away the voice of other people, which is, in part about control.

Ava's mother gets ovarian cancer and dies. Grandpa Sawtooth is placed in a home a month before her death. Ava starts doing her mother's act. A new theme park called The World of Darkness opens on the mainland and Swamplandia's visitors drop off dramatically. It is easier to get to (tourists have to take a 40 minute ferry to get to Swamplandia). Ava rarely thinks "dad" --- she usually thinks "the Chief" instead.

I did all the flowers myself. I stopped by Sam's and seriously bought them out of white flowers. Then, I looked for anything "plum"...and then picked up a few green stems, greenery, and baby's breath. I think I spent about $150 all together and I was able to make 10 mini arrangements for the head table, a large arrangement for the food table, and 10 more "small" arrangements for the guest tables...I also make 22 tussy mussy bouquets that went down the center aisle in the sanctuary. (I wasn't in the ceremony, so I don't have any pictures yet. BOO. I made 30 of the tussy mussies (paper cones with a ribbon handle)...I'll have to do a post on them when I get some pictures from the photographer.)

I love the bright, fun colors. For the title, I used some American Crafts Thickers from my stash. The tag behind the title is also from my stash but not sure where I originally got it. I used a color mist from October Afternoon - Comet Tail orange - to color the Heidi Swapp banner and to add some drops of color to the background paper. The journaling spot is die cut from Spellbinders Nestabilities Labels One.

Let me describe what she looked like. She wore tight blue jeans that rolled up around her ankles. Blue ballet slipper shoes with pink socks. Her shirt was nice and loose, except it had glittery polkadots–also it was tight around the shoulders and it squeezed the excess fat around her thin arms. Her blonde hair was tied up in a way that if you saw her from behind you might think she’s twenty. She was a young looking grandmother, if that makes sense. Her face was really saggy, probably from too much alcohol in her life–but you could only tell her approximate age by being close to her.

The surgeon we went to, Dr. Elizabeth Coryllos, explained that she would do the frenotomy in the office and she would numb him under his tongue. I began to cry. She assured me it would not be painful to him and he would be able to nurse right away. I told her that was not why I was crying. I explained to her I was upset that I was not able to solve this on my own, that as a professional and as a mom I felt like a failure. Then she gave me the best advice I have ever heard as a mom. She said even if I was the best race car driver in the world and I had the best car ever built I could not win the race if a tree fell across the track. Someone would have to remove the barrier so my car and I could continue on our journey. It was not my fault that nursing was not going well. I had the best baby in the world and I was the best mom for him; we just needed to remove the barrier to continue on our journey.In an AAP newsletter on breastfeeding, the article Congenital Tongue-Tie and its Impact on Breastfeeding (PDF) explains the four types of tongue tie and how they can affect breastfeeding.

The draft came and went last weekend, and I came away very impressed with the Cleveland Browns draft. As I wrote previously, the Browns had, and still have some holes to plug, but they certainly eliminated a good share of them in this draft. The NFL is certainly a passing league, but the weather turns bad in Cleveland earlier than most cities, and with the winds whipping across Lake Erie, a strong running game is needed in Cleveland. For this very reason, I am glad the Browns traded up one spot to ensure they would get running back Trent Richardson of Alabama. Keep in mind that the Browns had 13 draft picks, so giving away 3 late round picks to move up one spot did not hurt the Browns.

On another note, I got a sweet potato roll today for lunch…thinking it would be as good as the one I had in NY…total fail! The sweet potato was crunchy! Eww! You can’t eat half soft, half crunchy sweet potatoes in a sushi roll!!! At least my cucumber avocado roll was refreshing. It was SO hot today I didn’t feel like eating at all, but I thought to myself ‘why, a nice sushi roll would be wonderful on such a hot day,’ (talking in weird snobby accent!) lol wrong! I would have rather rolled my arm in rice and ate that haha I think I’m over sushi for a while now….stupid sweet potato! haha

So, after making my carrot lemonade, I decided to take those peels, and make limoncello. This time with Truvia. I basically took the peels from 6 lemons and 2 oranges (just the peel, no pith, use a vegetable peeler before cutting). I put those in a container and covered with a 750 ml bottle of 100 proof vodka. I covered with plastic and let sit on the counter for five days.

The first group of turnips are finally starting to bulb out as well! Soon I will be pulling that row, making more room for the broccoli to grow and for the second group of turnips to get bigger. I'm also getting ready to plant round four of radishes. They are growing better than I could have wished for, and they are a very tasty treat in my daily salads. I can't wait until I get to add the tomatoes and cucumbers!
What I'm saying is every once in awhile I wish something would happen similar to some of these movie plots that would test how I would really act. Something like a minor alien/zombie/robot invasion. That way I'd know if I'm adequately trained for the real deal. So far I've been in a couple high pressure situations, and I acted instinctively (and correctly), but there were no flesh-eating corpses, mind-scrambling extraterrestrials or homocidal machinery nearby at those times (at least none I was aware of).

In some ancient cultures, like the Celts, the term tying the knot was quite literal. Symbolic cords tied the couple together, symbolizing their union as one. Some ceremonies just draped the cords over them while others actually bound the couple together at the wrists. The ceremony itself was a very simple ritual called handfasting. The bride and groom were bound together by a ceremonial rope, cord, a piece of the family's tartan or other symbolic wrap.
They are cute and I do like them though the proportions were never quite right and it was simply time for something different.

The U.S., in purple with a Gini coefficient of 0.450, ranks near the extreme end of the inequality scale. Looking for the other countries marked in purple gives you a quick sense of countries with comparable income inequality, and it’s an unflattering list: Cameroon, Madagascar, Rwanda, Uganda, Ecuador. A number are currently embroiled in or just emerging from deeply destabilizing conflicts, some of them linked to income inequality: Mexico, Côte d’Ivoire, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Serbia.

Parents warned that white girls as young as 12 are being screwed by older Muslim men but Police and groups with responsibility to protect women pretend it is not happening or that this grooming our youngsters is not racial. Parents claim that there are networks to use our young girls while the authorities are frightened to do anything. The issue is not that they are having sex with under-age girls but that they are using our women for gratification when they have their own women.

Jack’s father loses his job and the family has to leave town. The uprooting is the most painful the boys have experienced. Everything is lost, it seems, friends, the house, the neighborhood, memories, … But among the loss, we hear the graceful voice of Jack’s mother: “The only way to be happy is to love. Unless you love, your life will flash by… Do good, wonder, hope.” Yet poignantly, she experiences the most devastating blow later, the death of her own son. We hear her heartbreaking whisper in voice over: “Where were you? Did you know?” Again, reiterating the questions that were on Job’s mind.
A few weeks ago I made my own laundry detergent and I have to say I have been pretty happy with it. I love that it is all natural, plus it's super cheap.

Our biggest piece of advice is to organize and research. Give yourself only one or two tasks at a time so as it does seem overwhelming. Everything will and does get done, but having a focus helps keep you sane. If you are planning to send save the dates or a wedding website, this might be a good place to start. This takes some of the stress out of having to choose another vendor and helps get the bride and groom excited for what is to come. If an engagement party is being planned, it is also a good time to focus on that and have some fun before diving into some of the other tasks. If the engagement party is the only pre-wedding party that you will be having(i.e. no bridal shower), bride and grooms usually opt to register. If this is the case, registering for the party before the invites are mailed will also be priority.

That’s not true. It is not all about seeing homosexuals become hetereosexuals. This is not the message of the gospel. The gospel is about all types of sinners (like me) who are unbelievers becoming believers. The gospel of Jesus Christ is not discriminatory, it is all inclusive: we are all sinners. I am pretty consistent in talking to all types of people about Christ. This is the thing that encourages me in this whole thing: the gospel of Christ is being presented. God will forgive people. He will give a clean-slate to all who turn from sin and trust in Jesus.

The quality of the bluebird images isn’t the greatest, but there will be plenty of better opportunities later in the Spring, after they have settled in and aren’t so skittish. If the normal pattern of arrivals holds true, the American Goldfinches and Western Tanagers will be along within a month. Although this happens every year, it is always exciting to see them come back, as they announce the season of renewal. Watching the dormant trees fill with leaves, seeing the dry grass become overtaken by new growth and interspersed with wildflowers, welcoming the offspring of livestock and wildlife; all are amazing and refreshing to the soul.
Conservatives have a clear either/or choice. Either they support life in a democracy with equal opportunity and adequate pay, or they must admit to the fact that the course they are on leads inevitably to plutocracy, inequality, non-democracy, and inescapable poverty for a large part of the population. If they want to claim that all persons must be responsible for themselves, they must support the rights of all persons to a Living Wage sufficient to pay for health care and savings for old age. It’s a clear choice. You can’t vote for unequal pay and then say you are for democracy.
Aside from going slightly over my allotted time (next time I do a panel presentation, I'm going to have a timer right in front of me), my only regret about SXSW Interactive has been not getting to fully immerse myself in it due to time-sensitive projects at work, gearing up for SXSW Music, Kate's busy schedule, tax preparation and wanting to see my son for a couple of hours over the weekend. There's a lot of potential synergy between emerging technologies and public health in everything from disease management to patient advocacy to data management. Here's hoping SXSW Interactive's embrace of health continues in coming years.
.."In the late 1880s, the body of a 16-year-old girl was pulled from the Seine. She was apparently a suicide, as her body showed no marks of violence, but her beauty and her enigmatic smile led a Paris pathologist to order a plaster death mask of her face.
The other undertone I thought could possibly be there is that King on several occasions makes references to the fact that Cujo is a good dog. He didn’t want to do the things he wound up doing. He simply became the victim of a terrible disease that turned him into something completely different than what he is. Kind of sounds like something someone might think about themselves while in the deep pit of drug addiction. They might not want to be doing the things to their friends and family that they are, but the addiction takes over and turns them into something completely different. (Now, before you jump on my case here, I do recognize there is a subtle difference. Drugs addicts are responsible for their situation in that they chose to get involved, and they can choose to quit – as difficult as it might be for them. Cujo did not choose to get rabies, and once he got it there was nothing he could do about it. Though, it’s not hard to see how someone in the grip of addiction might try to take the argument of being a victim).
I am not going to make it 10 days. That’s how long Prudy, our boxer pup, has to wear the “cone” since she was spayed. Somehow, we are supposed to keep this hyper dog “calm” for 10 days so she doesn’t pop her stitches. Talk about impossible! The first two days we had the hard plastic cone, aka the lampshade, aka the satellite dish. It was awful! Pru would walk past things and knock them over. We lost an entire potted plant to the plastic cone. We would take her outside and the cone would get caught on the door, trees, you name it.

But there is an ominous explanation that lay behind this folly—an even greater folly: (1) They “did not remember the Lord their God, who had rescued them from the hands of all their enemies,” and (2) they “failed to show kindness” (Judg. 8:34-35).
Being that the players are in shells today it is very hard to take much of anything from practice today for the running back group. However, both Chris Polk (Washington) and Doug Martin (Boise State) showed nice burst and acceleration from the little I was able to see of them today. Surely this will be a solid battle as well this week as I have both rated pretty closely and their performance this week will go a long way in separating themselves from one another in the minds of talent evaluators. Both players came in very strong with Martin showing up at a strong 5-9 219 lbs., while Polk came in at a sturdy 5-10 224 lbs. Both have the look of potential feature backs in the NFL with the capability to produce for whichever team chooses to draft them. Issiah Pead (Cincinatti) however did not look the part and I was disappointed to see him weigh in at a slight 5-9 193 lbs. I didn’t get to see much of any of Ohio State’s Daniel “Boom” Herron however and will have more on him in the coming days.
And, yes, I broke down and jumped on the Chiang Mai Dragon bandwagon and ordered pillows in the mocha color way. I know it’s been seen everywhere on blogs but the combination of colors is still my favorite:

For a voluntary group like Transition Newcastle, it is so important that we make our meetings something that people want to come to. I think this weekend worked well in creating an environment that is inviting and I hope we all felt energised and enthusiastic.
A quiet Saturday at our house (read: boring Saturday). Prince Charming had to work and JB is still under the weather, so we played at home all day. The kids made a bakery in their bedroom. Miss M was the brains behind the idea but JB was happy to help, and then destroy, and then help, and then destroy. It was very cute, and although I thought we might have enough play food for two small children, today's adventure indicates we do not. So I am going to try my friend Megan's idea, she crafted some cute baked goods with her son...check it out!

Many forms of cancer often lessen hunger. Persons suffering of the sickness find it not easy to eat due in part to stress, unease, queasiness, exhaustion and many, various side-effects of their treatments. Thus, with reduction in appetite, it is important to make sure that when they are ready to eat, cancer patients consume healthy foods that are high in protein and calories. Choosing foods such as olives, dried fruits and nuts are good choices. Make an attempt to stay away from unhealthy synthetic sugars that can be found in candies, sodas and other sweets as these sugars can help to disrupt the cell division process; which, when left unbalanced, can lead to the development of a number of cancers
Worse for Chen is his uncomfortable and embarrassing opposition to China’s population control agenda, a policy supported by the Obama administration and in particular the State Department, which is spendingtens of billions of dollars on such programs worldwide. Although the administration gives lip-service against coercive abortion and sterilization, it is simultaneously helping to finance the Chinese population control machine with tens of millions of dollars in subsidies to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), which helps to administer China’s brutal one-child policy.
I had a lovely few days visiting DD as she can't be home for Easter due to Uni work, her final exams start next month. It was a shame the weather was so cold, but at least we didn't get any snow, unlike DH who was left at home!
Had a lovely night at Bracken Edge. Thai/oriental themed night. Won tons, satay chicken, temporah. Went to bed at 9:30. Woke up at 5:30 fully wide awake. Got a Tropicana orange and lime from the fridge, chucked the dog out my room and went back to land of slumber until 9.

Hubby stayed playing and said he be back to the chalet in an hour or so to make dinner. I told him he didn't need to cook, but he already had dinner planned so that is what he was going to do. He got back and I didn't notice anything until he bumped into the wall and said, "Alcohol sucks!" He was DRUNK! LOL! I knew he planned to drink, but I didn't pay attention to what or how much he was drinking, as he is not much of a drinker anymore. Well, someone should have paid attention, I guess. He was too funny and I watched him really closely. Once he got some food in him, he was a little better. He had talked about going back to the casino, but decided to stay in and watch a little tv and go to bed.
Here is a nice big version of the stunning cover on the Science Fiction Book Club's Omnibus edition of the Parasol Protectorate Vol 2. This edition is only available to club members (although sometimes they show up online for sale later) and is a hardback limited run containing the final two books in the series, Heartless and Timeless. It should be coming out in the USA right about the same time as Timeless.

The irony is that the very things that make a writer come up with a story - the frustration, even the anger at the lack of success and recognition - are the very themes that make the writing project work for the eventual audience.

As I’ve chronicled over the last few months the brewjersey blog has always been in search of the best craft beer in South Jersey and Philly. I want to concentrate just on South Jersey for this post. To narrow it down even more, the area of South Jersey between Philadelphia, Wilmington and Glassboro. There are a few great craft beer bars in the area and I am including an interactive map to showcase some of these great bars. A few of these bars have been mentioned in previous posts and some will be mentioned here for the first time.

Inside the city limits, you can call the City Animal Shelter but if you are located outside the city limits, there is really no one to call for help. Rogers County does not have an animal shelter.

Due to a banking problem, many (including me) PCVs did not get paid on time. I was a few days into my scrumptious tomato paste and rice diet when another PCV came to visit, not only with her lovely smile – but also some food! I had fun showing her around my village and with two abazungu out and about, we were certainly the center of attention. While it’s easy to get stuck and held up on all the challenges of your site, it was really refreshing to have an outside perspective remind me of all the awesome things that make my site great. I may live in a food desert with no electricity for miles, but if those are my two challenges, I’ll take it.
I've recently started a small (very small!) not for profit organisation called, "Lia Nain Books For Timor". Lia Nain is a person in the village who is responsible for keeping tradition, story and culture alive and the idea of the little organisation is to collect stories from the Timorese, and to put them into books (mostly children's) and have them published and distributed across Timor (in Tetun) and Australia (in English). I guess the idea (and the passion!) is that there are SO many stories in Timor - of courage, strength, resilience, family, love and hope, and no one can tell them better than the people themselves. There is also a shortage of books in Tetun (although this is slowly increasing!) and a general lack of knowledge and understanding in Australia (and the world) about Timor.

The fact that they’re not dead is a major break with even modern vampire mythology. The only exception I could think of was the Marvel Comics character Morbius: the Living Vampire. In Haig’s version of reality vampirism is a condition that can be passed on in one of two ways, by being inherited from one’s birth parents or by being converted in much the same fashion as described in Bram Stoker’s Dracula: a vampire's bite alone is not enough to turn a human into a vampire; the human, when near death, must drink the sire's blood. The only difference is that you don’t need to die afterwards, oh, and the age difference between converter and converted needs to be less than a decade.

Everybody smelled the big money that night in the bar. Mulcahy later learned that the final contract with Qaddafi called for a total payment of $35 million for 500,000 timers whose cost to supply, he knew, would be somewhere around $2.5 million. Even in the international-arms business, profits like that are not easy to come by.
This is not a retread of the usual debate of Traditional Jazz versus New Jazz. This is an examination of jazz losing it's way in order to find its way. Jazz transcending jazz to be...I don't even know - cosmic improvisation? tathagata-jam? The definition of jazz is not expanding, it is evaporating. The musicians in this documentary play improvisational music built on a number of influences beside the tradition of Jazz. They're soaking in the world and living a philosophy of improvisation within community, treating the music as a living organism. The music is incredible! Hip hop jazz orchestras, metal blues bop, and freestyle rhythmic vitality. The music is alive and well and going in new directions.

These buyers preferred Indian ships, because of better jointing technology and elimination of metal sheeting. Indian shipbuilders had a special system where wood was seasoned in partial vacuum, with oils for timber improvement. British shipbuilders, colonialists ensured through tariff and other barriers, that Indian shipbuilding “was prevented from continuing to develop, even though it had a proven ability to adapt to changing technological needs” – and thus finally killing it. British naval superiority rested on Indian ships – and paid for by exploitation of Indian resources.

In either case, the house could be gaining heat from the exterior faster than the air conditioning can produce cold air. This could cause the system to run continuously. Again, it is recommended that all of these issues be reviewed by a qualified contractor.
The other reason I gave up on this book is I felt there was a fundamental hypocrisy at work. It purports, in passages like that quoted above, to analyze and, to some extent, judge Rogers’ treatment as an object of prurience by the press and the public at large. Well, yeah. And why exactly did you choose this subject for your book anyway? Perhaps because you realized that people are fascinated with crime, particularly crimes against attractive young women? Perhaps that’s why you also included the word sex in your title? Edgar Allan Poe got it and he didn’t feel the need to cast himself as a moral authority who is horrified by other people’s interest while he was doing it. Then again, he didn’t have Foucault and Derrida to tell him what was really going on.

This is a colossal series that I cannot rate high enough. It’s steamy with true love and romance in addition to being well-researched with characters that make you want to be a Mackenzie, for all their craziness. Jennifer Ashley writes under a few different names and has some other series (I enjoy her shifter series, too) but this is her best work. I’m eagerly awaiting the next two books in the series, The Seduction of Elliot McBride (Ainsley’s brother who was tortured in India and is trying to make a life back in England) and The Wicked Deeds of Daniel Mackenzie (cannot wait to hear Daniel’s story!!). Sadly, these two books aren’t due out until 2013, but Jennifer Ashley has plenty of other great books to read in the meantime. Check her out!

I finally have permission from my doc, as of today, to return to 40 hours a week of work, but no extra hours. That's great, and is an accurate reflection of my ongoing return to good health. But I'm sitting here trying to figure out how I'm going to squeeze 40 hours of work in around the medical needs of those I care for.
Scoop caramel topping into a saucepan and heat over low heat until caramel is soft and easy to stir. Pour the caramel over the nougat layer.

But the true star of the show has undoubtedly been Conte himself. The manager arrived with only a modest CV – he had taken each of Bari and Siena up from Serie B, with an unsuccessful spell at Atalanta inbe tween – but the full backing of supporters who believed that as a former captain he would appreciate the significance of the role. He arrived declaring this team “must get used to using the word Scudetto again”, then promptly refused to acknowledge reporters’ suggestions that his team even had a shot at the title until the final two months of the season.
I took this photo while taking Tallis for a walk along the local cycle path. He and I only discovered the river section a few week ago, and this was the first time the ground was dry enough to allow us to make our way down the slope to the river edge without slip-sliding all the way. Well, Tallis could have made it quite happily, but he goes on the lead for this section and I wasn't about to let him tow me along!!!

On the fiction side, Ali Dougal said that the market continues to be dominated by PARANORMAL fiction, though ‘Twilight’ has finally seen a dip in demand. Those that are hot right now are about Angels and Werewolves. Books that have made it into film are big sellers for publishers, such as the Percy Jackson series. For Egmont, the biggest revenue continues to come from their backlist which includes Enid Blyton books (now being repackaged). Due to Steven Spielberg’s upcoming film ‘Warhorse’, the corresponding book has become Egmont’s very own ‘Twilight’. Other successful books are the ‘GONE’ series, as well as ‘Mr. Gum’ and ‘Lemony Snicket’. Egmont has obviously also followed the Paranormal trend, as seen through ‘The Dark Divine’ books (by Bree Despain). They also have an Angel trilogy coming out.

As a little girl I felt ostracized at times from all the other children in our school mainly because of my mother’s undesirable reputation but also for the fact that we were poor. I didn’t understand why people looked down on us when I tried so desperately to be accepted by the other children. Even some teachers treated me as "white trash." Now, years later, I have seen the same thing repeat itself over and over and over. As a teen I observed the "white" folks looking down on the "colored" folks as they searched for the bathrooms labeled "Colored" and "Whites." We were told to not use the water fountains marked "blacks" and in my heart I struggled feeling guilty for loving them. I just didn’t know any different. There was much confusion! God has not allowed me to forget those days of hurt because He wants it to be placed as a bridge from my heart to others. It helps me to love more and to make peace, if you will. There must always be a peacemaker. Are you a peacemaker or are you the opposite?
Let’s face it, you don’t want it to be legal because it less dangerous than alcohol, and you don’t really care about the possibility of reducing gang involvement in it. You want to smoke it, plain and simple. Stop bullshitting me with your pseudo-logical arguments and claims that it is for the good of society or the nation. Say it with me, “I want to smoke weed, and I don’t want it to be illegal for me to do that”. I would respect everyone a lot more if they would at least cop to that more explicitly, and would appreciate it if they started all of their tirades against prohibition with it.

We also learn about her mother, who had Devon when she was sixteen, and how Devon strives to be nothing like her.
The Beldings were scandalized years ago when a creative produced a commercial the client hadn't approved, bought time and ran it at midnight on a tv station in Palookaville, Nebraska so it would qualify, and then actually won a Belding for it. He was eventually exposed for the fraud, and it resulted in a complete overhaul of the Belding rules and requirements. The show ambled on for a few more years, then basically died because no one cared anymore.

It's interesting to note that I was not raised like this, even remotely. Not that I was abused or anything like that, but I can recall many, many more times that I was spoken to disrespectfully as a small child and even an older child than respectfully. I don't have to go in to it here, but suffice to say, although we had a culture of love and affection, we did not have a culture of respect and kindness. I was ridiculed, told directly and indirectly that I didn't know what I was feeling, shamed, the works. In my family of origin, fear and shame were the great motivators. But, you know that can only get someone so far.
Now people ask how do we fix this? The wealthy and those who have not fallen off of the employment wagon say there is no problem. Those that say that either have no heart or do not care about fellow humans or are undereducated. This how I would fix it. I would tax or charge corporations fees for sending jobs to other countries, instead of giving tax beaks for shipping jobs overseas like they are getting now. I would also make it a law that the C.E.O.’s can not own stock, that way they do not make decisions for their own gains. Instead of bonuses for the management I would implement a law that would only allow profit-sharing for all the workers, from the janitor to the president. Do not think this is wealth distribution, heck it’s the people under management who make the companies the goods to sell for profit.

Grits tends to operate on the assumption that most folks are acting in good faith until they give me reason to believe otherwise. This bizarre, corrupt episode makes me call such assumptions into question. It would never occur to me that local juvenile judges might so brazenly abuse their authority, though I guess after the judge in Pennsylvania was convicted for taking kickbacks for sending youth to a private facility, one shouldn't be surprised. Even so, I must admit, I am.

I would love to hear thoughts on this from Jews.
The book began as a vague idea which I dreamed up in conversations with Val Brathwaite, the brilliant art editor at Bloomsbury. I had no story, and no idea of what the setting or the style would be; I just knew that I wanted to do an illustrated adventure story, with a picture every few pages and a full-page one in every chapter. At first I planned a fantasy - I had a particular illustrator in mind, and thought I could come up with a tale of magic and monsters which would suit his style. But I thought and thought, and no story appeared. Magic just didn't seem to be my thing. Monsters, however, I definitely wanted to do. One of the few rules I stuck to while writing the Mortal Engines quartet was that there were no monsters; there are no weird unearthly creatures in that future world, and certainly no non-human intelligences (unless you count the Stalkers, but even they were human once). I rather fancied a chance to fill a book with fabulous beings, and over the years I'd even doodled a few, like this Friendly Crab.
What it Involved:
It was bedtime for the girls, so we sent them to change into their pajamas and brush their teeth. A lot of giggling and squealing came from that end of the house, but it's not unusual, so we didn't think twice about it. Then Children A and B came to say that C had thrown everything off the top bunk. That's where A sleeps. She has a lot of stuffed animals and blankets up there, so adult intervention was required at this point. And neither A nor B were in their pajamas.
The protagonist does not wear uniform like the other cops, telling us that he is a higher rank and is good at his job. He wears sunglasses and a suit to make the audience admire him for how cool he is, he is silent throughout the opening sequence and doesn’t say anything too the other policemen, which tells us that they may not get a long, and whilst he may be the protagonist, he might not be very liked in his profession, and gives the impression that he is more like a badass than a hero. Which due to the ideology of the film the audience could guess that they would find out why the other policemen don’t like him, they could also figure out that the protagonist will either catch or kill the antagonist.
Now, looking ahead at the Millennium, if the multihusband-multiwife system is re-introduced among the people and becomes the marriage model for those thousand years, we end up with people who will live just as long as Adam and Eve and will be just as fertile and produce just as many offspring as they did, but with one exception: the first thousand years started with two people only, while the seventh thousand years will start with a vast multitude of people. A thousand years of such peace, progress and posterity will overflow this planet with people. When this planet is filled to the brim with people, the very next year the population will more than double, requiring a second planet upon which to reside. Each succeeding year the population explosion will require more and more planets for all the people. We look at all the planets in the heavens and wonder what they are for, just floating around, supposedly not serving any purpose. Well, it may be that they will find a very important use in the Millennium.

This is going to be a reassuring, although perhaps confusing, post. I was reading queries tonight and someone mentioned that they were, as per my instructions from another post, querying me with a finished manuscript. And that reminded me that I had recently signed up a client who had queried me with only part of her manuscript complete. And that reminded me that I had within the last few years signed and sold two new writers based on queries that were not very strong, technically speaking, and didn't have the elements I like to see, like comp titles, but just had *something* about them that appealed to me; in one case a fun, confident voice, and in the other, good sample pages.

Do I think school has value? To quote JTG, School may have value, just not supreme value. School could be just a waste of time til you are an adult, can work and not burden other adults. Schooling is not so much about education as it is about obedience and learning only the basics.

Happy Halloween! I am sure those of you who celebrate are planning to take lots of photos of the festivities.
I want a president who prays to the One True God. Who reads the Holy Bible, believing it’s the the only inspired word of God and not unholy books like the Book of Mormon. A man whose prayers I know God hears. A man of God who hears from God. (John 10:27) Not a man who believes he may one day be a god himself.
Ale Stars at The Local Taphouse saw in the festive season last night with a joyous celebration of good company, good cheer and plenty of good beer. Seasonal and Christmas Ales was the theme and the room was filled with the now unmistakable ‘air of Ale Star’ – packed to overflowing with spirit and friendship and chatter and hand-shaking and the sudden need to employ the use of a microphone for the host to be heard.
On another note, the way that authority is established and enforced often times can effect how we act or react to it. If we are driving our car down the road obeying the rules and posted speed limits and we are pulled over by a policeman before the policeman even reaches our window a multitude of thoughts may cross our mind, from thinking what in the world am I being pulled over for, to this guy must be short on meeting his quota or even feeling nervous about some infraction that you may have committed while in a daydream and simultaneously driving. However, once the officer reaches the window how you feel about being under authority will come to the surface when you respond to the officer.
SCC: Your plot is all too scarily believable, but, of course, those exact right ingredients for your explosive mix would have to be in place for this to happen in real life, (which is hopefully unlikely). However, do you think that we, as a society, are in real danger of creating a situation like this, by making our young people powerless, disenfranchised and demotivated to engage with the world?
As soon as I saw a sweetroll in Skyrim for the first time I immediately exclaimed ‘That’s a Gugelhupf!’ Since then I’ve been meaning to do this video and now I finally got round to it! A Gugelhupf is a very popular cake that comes from the German-speaking regions (which is where I come from) and comes in sweet as well as savoury varieties. I realised that many people might not know about this cake and would never have the joy of baking their own sweetroll. And that’s just unacceptable!

If you and your partner are so visibly in love and companionship that no one can help but see it, rest assured the SA sees it too. What's more fun than helping loving people? If you're alone or with friends (whom I'm sure you love--just saying there's a difference), dress with style. I am NOT talking about expensive labels. I am NOT talking about being Parisian chic. I'm talking about looking pulled together so that YOU feel confident. My most beautiful experiences in Hermès all happened when I wasn't dressed up (in Hermès or anything else)--a simple skirt, a simple leather jacket, a Longchamp or Coach bag.

Playing with Graveyard, who are quite popular (for good reasons) there should be quite a few people we will turn on to us instead. Unfortunately we have not yet got the budget, or the time onstage, to perform the gig with the stage production as we have envisioned it but we will make the most out of it. Playing wise we will play some songs from the EP but mostly new stuff and considering no one outside the band have heard these songs it’s going to be a win-over-the-crowd performance which I am confident we will do!
Next came relocation. Whitehorse was sent to the Bay area to learn a vocation, then was pressured to stay and work. During this time, she went to Alcatraz, two months after the initial takeover in 1969. This came at the time of Black Panthers and protests of the Vietnam War. San Francisco offered an education.
You'd think we'd had enough by this point, wouldn't you? But how could we leave before witnessing a 'vampire' facelift??! This procedure was doubley intriguing for me. Obviously, the inner goth was awakened at the very mention of a vampire, but also because the procedure doesn't involve injecting any foreign bodies into the skin. Known professionally as PRP (Platelet Rich Plasma), a vampire facelift involves the doctor taking blood from the patient, spinning it around to separate the plasma and then injecting your own plasma back into your skin. Susan, my microdermabrasion nurse, was desperate to have this done even though, in her own words, "you look a little bit like a frog for a few days afterwards". Apparently it is the only procedure which lifts the eyelids and attacks the fine lines just under the eyes. We plucked up the courage to have a quick peek at this one before we left. I was glad to see that the needle looked a little shorter, but the whole concept of having someone jabbing about my eye with any kind of needle gives me the willies...
This basically means that as your foot strikes the ground, the impact can cause hemolysis (damage or death) to your red blood cells. You do regenerate your blood cells, but excessive hemolysis can cause your iron level (hemoglobin) and iron stores (ferritin) to drop.
With the start of 2010, the solar Light Energies caused pains and pressure in one area in the left (from the old 3D system of duality–female) side of my head/skull. My entire scalp and skull felt bruised and was sore constantly. The previous and familiar “Ascension Flu” solar symptoms had eased considerably with some of them gone entirely, but in 2010 it was painfully clear they were now focused in my/our heads, brains, and brain glands (Pituitary and Pineal primarily). With the larger solar flares/CME in 2010, 2011, and 2012 my body still experiences chills like when you have a fever, but my head has hurt with tremendous inner pains and pressures (not “headaches”) nearly constantly. Even though this head pain and pressure is constant it increases and diminishes in waves. The head pain is always there but sometimes much more painfully so than at other minutes, hours, days and nights.
The end of Ms Wente's column reveals a further source of Ms Wente's information. That would be the Autism Speaks video, "Autism Every Day", which Ms Wente describes as "a glimpse of a day in the life of autism parents". She fails to see "Autism Every Day" as a glimpse at what autistic children have to endure, every day, when they are seen as appalling burdens, when they're talked around and shunted around as though they're non-sentient props. Ms Wente demonstrates that when you dehumanize autistics enough, as Ms Lewis so proficiently does, right down to pulling our teeth if we don't behave, then we disappear altogether, so that the only humans Ms Wente can perceive in "Autism Every Day" are the parents.
The institution of marriage has been completely obliterated by gender queers. This is a term I plan to use more regularly here.

The first goal is to load inventory. It currently takes about an hour to research, photograph and write a description for each item. But, wait! How did I ever acquire so much inventory when I never had a store? I’m like a little bird collecting little shiny objects and curious. I think they’re unique. Hope others do to.

One of Mozilla’s major projects this year will be the development of a tech preview browser that conforms to Microsoft’s Metro UI. A peek inside the wiki page reveals that the first version is designed to use existing Win 32 libraries to avoid having to completely port the current set to WinRT. The new front-end’s language is still under debate, as is the question of how the existing Firefox UI should change to conform to Metro’s rules.
From the Rock and Rollers of the 1950s to the Ravers of the 90s, we should not forget all the brilliant art and human potential that has been unleashed by rebels butting against oppressive ways that rigidly bound people into narrow patterns of behaviour, alienating and often destroying anyone that differed from an oppressive norm. Individualism may have damaged community, but it allowed the potential of people to be who they wanted to be, and we should not forget that. Such liberty was hard-won.
The ring in the lower wing is not an onion ring but a chain tatted over a ring and joined back to the base of the ring. To hold the chain in place, it is joined to the top of the ring, in this case, with a Catherine Wheel join. I made the antennae with long twisted picots.
I don't agree with everything John Derbyshire says but but he can sometimes produce some very prescient comments and, to quote from one of his various essays on the British Empire “When the Empire got properly into its stride, humanitarianism was a major driving force. Slavery was abolished throughout Britain's possessions in 1834, and much of the work of the Royal Navy through the middle decades of the 19th century was devoted to the suppression of slave trafficking by peoples of other nations- including this one (the USA). The British colony of Sierra Leone was founded as a refuge for freed slaves, a dozen years before Liberia. The drive to eliminate slavery was fueled by evangelical Christianity, which, in the form of missionary activity, continued to be an important element of the imperial thrust well into the 20th century, especially in Africa.”
In order to maintain the necessary continuity for my new phase of regular and responsive blogging, here is a quick summary of what has been happening in my life during these recent days of radio silence.
Most of the Sharpies were dried up. Tossed.
The hosts made much fuss about their new ale, billed as a "dark IPA" and named, following a public competition, "Perfect Storm". This is an experimental blend of Leann Folláin and O'Hara's IPA (how very Mikkeller!) and it's a battle that the stout is winning: a big sweet chocolate hit dominates the taste with only a mild fruitiness backing it up. For the next iteration I'd suggest seriously ramping up the IPA levels in the blend, and then dry-hopping in the cask (but I would say that).
In 1998 I was also very active with Cystic Fibrosis Awareness. I had a website that started out being for Heather and Holly and also for educational purposes. I was chairmen of the local Great Strides Walk to benefit the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. I did this up until 2003. In 1998, I was also very active on a list-serv called Cystic-L. My goal at that time was to network with families, gain information and spread awareness.
3) There are those who compromise with culture and are temporarily protected, and those who stand firm with Christ to their temporary detriment. Written during the height of Roman imperial and pagan worship, Revelation shows us that risk of persecution is not a legitimate reason to sin. Revelation was written to both encourage suffering Christians, and to strongly warn those compromising their faithful witness. We would do well to heed the warnings.

Grayson was in love with me.
After my slip that morning, I spent the next hour or so making a point of talking to Dr. Pip and Dr. Polly as I brought each of the dolls out for their turn in the examining room. Much to my relief, Pip eventually began parroting this manner of address as well. In some respects it seems like such a little thing, but at the moment these little things are what we can do. One day Ava and I will be able to have those conversations with Polly and Pip where we will talk about history and statistics and the reproduction of inequalities. For now, though, we have to try and show them what could be possible and hope that through this showing they learn to imagine and work for what the world should be instead of accepting as good enough what the world has already been.
When I starting craving fish tacos a week ago, I kept thinking to myself that Son wouldn't like it, Daughter #2 would probably pick out all the green, and Daughter #1 might complain about the messiness of eating it. (Daughter #1 is a meticulously neat eater.) The level and noise from the complaints pretty much made me decide that making the fish tacos really wouldn't be worth it at all, so I sort of put it on the back burner. But the craving never quite disappeared. In fact, the craving continued, intensified, and gradually became something I could no longer ignore. I decided that TODAY I would ignore all potential detractors and instead just MAKE MY FISH TACOS and the rest of the detractors could just be hungry. I did what I wanted to do and no one could stop me.

Early on, I decided that my overriding goal would be to improve, to keep pushing myself. That’s why I write across genres and formats. That’s why I write humor and horror and romance and suspense. That’s why I write across age and race and region and gender and species.
Donohue's book is narrated by both Julia and Anna, alternating chapters. Although initially I felt more connected to Anna, Julia's narration gave her character more depth and she was also easily likeable. This was a fast and fun read and a women's fiction book that is enjoyable and entertaining.

Sure, there were things that we never fully got used to being the school girls we were raised to be but even those somehow shocking stuff were less and less disturbing after a while. Or rather some of us found ways to avoid looking at what we don’t want to see or not to think about what we don’t want to think about. We learned to be girls scouts and know how to work around a potential problem.
What a wonderful Canadian performer. This man has gone along ways with his career. He performed many of his impersonations that he has done over the years. He portrayed Ed Grimley, Giminy Glick and Franck the Wedding Planner to name a few. He also did his impression of Katherine Hepburn, Liz Taylor, Richard Burton and even Betty Davis. He had the audience in stitches throughout his 1 and half hour performance.

The Angels Share-Bourbon Barrel Aged: 12%
Gradually, these brave men and women won the hearts and minds of villagers, who for generations had found solace in the chanting of local shamans and the worshiping of pagan gods. Over the past century, the Christian faith has passed down from generation to generation despite the government’s brutal persecution against Christians in the 1960s and 1970s. In those villages, Christianity has taken root and become a part of the local heritage. It is as indigenous and life-sustaining as qiaoba, a popular buckwheat cake. During my visit there, I never felt that the locals had embraced a foreign religion. It blended seamlessly with the local cultures. Villagers held their services led by local leaders in their native tongues, and celebrated their Eucharist or Christian holidays in a way that they knew the best—local delicacies. It definitely had a distinctive Chinese identity.
Oookay. For those of you who've already read THE EXILE several times (and _thank_ you, btw!

We don’t see them often today, but here’s a survivor, above the steps to the platforms at North Ealing station in west London. I wonder if it has been there since the station opened in 1903. Back then, this suburban station was on the first above-ground section of London’s Underground to run electric trains. It was in the van of modernization, in other words, but if the electric trains seemed to look forward to a new age, the letterforms on this sign seem to look backwards to the time of Queen Victoria and steam railways.
Except it was too big, taking up too much space in the sink and making it impossible to empty it into the compost pail without dumping grossness on the floor. The MiL remarked wistfully that when she was a girl and everyone still did dishes by hand, every hardware store carried strainers that fit into the corner of the sink. Well, every hardware store doesn't carry them now, but Amazon does. So I bought one, and though washing dishes certainly didn't cease to suck, at least valuable real estate in the sink has been restored and there are a lot fewer egg shells on the floor.

Blair’s controversial and well-known association world-famous oil despot Nursultan Nazarbayev, the President of Kazakhstan adds another point of contact between three men.

The paintings are very beautiful. When I had first put illustrations from this book on my Dreams of Space website (http://dreamsofspace.nfshost.com/) back in the 1990s, there was not as much space art content on the web.

On Sunday March 25 we blessed Oliver Richard Newman at our church, just a few days shy of 2 months old. It was so great to have my dad fly out for it, also in the circle was Bishop Andrew, our very good friend Jeff Yeager and our home teacher Russ Wilks. For those of you who don't know about baby blessings in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints I will explain a little. When a baby is born we have an opportunity to give the baby a name and a blessing. The name given during the blessing is the name on the records of the church.

Am I engaging in false hysteria? Not every movie has a strong lead character. A lot of movies are about weakness or mediocrity or foolishness.

I recently went to my doctor for my annual exam. This is a new family doctor for me and I really like her. I had intentions of seeing one of the other physicians in the office, but they were not accepting patients. It all turned out for the best though. She listens to me. She understands that I know my own body. When something isn’t right, I know and she listens. It also isn’t necessary for me to arrange an office visit every time I need something or have a problem. Sometimes I can call and she will write the prescription for me or she will return my call and discuss my issue with me over the phone. She calls and reports to me any test results as well. I really like her.

I do enjoy sharing them though, and especially turning people on to the joys of collage-making. If you've never done it, give it a try!

Because, of course, Nielsen don't do this out of the goodness of their corporate hearts. They sell the information. Publishers pay to be able to see the figures, and figures are not available without payment. So you or I can't see the sales of our books or any competing books, but publishers can. If you propose a new book, the publisher can check how well similar books sell. If you approach a new publisher, they can see how well your last book sold. Which is fine if it sold really well, but if it didn't - perhaps because it was badly marketed, or a similar book by a more famous author came out a week earlier - they may not want to take a chance on your next book.
Finally I combined all ingredients for the crapes in a large mixing bowel and used the hand mixer to beat them together. Until smooth. Line a plate with a paper towel or in my case I used a napkin. My pan was a little bigger so my crapes came out larger, I used a 1/2 cup measuring cup to place the batter into my pan, but if you have a smaller pan or crape pan a 1/4 cup should work. After you put the batter in your pan swirl the pan around so that you cover the bottom completely. Cook until the center is cooked and the edges are lightly browned, then carefully remove them placing them on your plate with a paper towel between each, repeat. When you finish this you can melt your butter sauce. (This could actually be warming up as you finish your last few crapes). Also reheat your fruit, I did this after my last crape by just putting the fruit into that pan until it was hot.
So let’s forget the ropey league form especially as we are away from home and let’s forget talk about how this season as a whole has panned out in terms of team performance and in the signings we’ve made.

Mobiles are generally one from the many remarkable issues to possess transpired to help us all not too long ago. Your world involving mobile phones has grew up at a very speedier rate. There is certainly rarely any individual who doesn’t employ a mobile phone today. While using appearance of numerous community providers the entire mobile phone circumstances has bought a different momentum. Mobile phone specials range via user to operator. So, it really is constantly an excellent thought to help study a little bit previous to zeroing within with mobile phone providers connected with a particular operator.

On the up side, I’ve gotten to spend some time hanging around with Jorin Deadeye, who used to pick on me like nobody’s business when we were kids, and didn’t get a whole lot better when we grew up. Everything with him was “Nice job your dad did dooming our people,” and “Damn, you’re a mopey, whiny little bitch” (and granted back in those days I WAS pretty emo, and I CAN’T IMAGINE WHY I WOULD HAVE BEEN KIND OF DOWN ON MYSELF AT THE TIME), and going around calling himself the “warchief” of the Bleeding Hollow clan instead of the chieftain. So I’ve been making a point of just hanging out wherever he’s been pretty regularly, and saying stuff to him like, “So hey, you like my axe? Yeah? Well check it, this is Gorehowl, the blade my dad used to FUCKING ONE-SHOT MANNOROTH and lift the blood haze from the orcs, how ’bout that, huh?” and “Hey, Chieftain, remind me, who’s actually Warchief these days? OH YEAH, SMALL WORLD!” Cue the comically appropriate Earth Online machinima:

We went to the RV dealerships a couple of times to get a feel and day dream.

One other intriguing element to all of this: Colangelo hired Paul Westphal when both were with the Phoenix Suns, then fired the former Suns star partly because the team featuring our beloved Charles Barkley lacked structure and discipline. And who targeted Cousins as the Kings’ biggest problem last season and early this year? It’s still hard to believe, given DeMarcus’ rapid development, but before he was fired after a 2-5 start, Westphal basically targeted Cousins as the Kings’ major problem and pressured management to make a trade. Ouch. Not a good move.

They can give us hope and even a kin ship that maybe sorely needed at the time.
I am really looking forward to a great year with a bunch of cute new kiddos!
Alan Titley, one of the pre-eminent critics in Irish, in "The Irish Book Review" noted the accuracy of Moriarty's translations, and my limited ability can verify this. Moriarty does, as Titley praises, enter into the spirit of the texts he gathers, and he resurrects many stories and tells them with vigorous compassion and hard-won wisdom. Rilke, D.H. Lawrence, Ted Hughes, Mircea Eliade, Marguerite Porete, William Law, Thomas Traherne, and Indian (in both senses of the adjective) sources speckle, as veins in quartz, his own integration of other-worldly reflections from around the world and across the centuries. Moriarty's range remains impressive. I am not sure how to build the Bird-Reign after ending this retelling of Irish sources, but I am impressed with his erudition put towards the cause of not self-promotion, as with so many scholars, but the betterment of us all, the weak and the struggling and not only the tenured and the acclaimed. His own decision, decades ago, to leave academia behind for his own vision-quest informs and enriches his work. While critics may scoff at his magpie eclecticism and his gnomic tone, I admit he earns my respect as well as my occasional bafflement. Luckily, a glossary explains most of his coinages, borrowings, and untranslated (in the text) phrases from Sanskrit or Irish.
What are we to make of this critique? To some extent he simply uses America as a foil for France. If Americans are moral, it is because they lack some aspect of French society that leads to immorality, but which makes the French somehow spiritually superior. As for his comments on American love – are European gallantries an answer to an American defect, and were they then? I tend to think not, and to see such elaborate and mannered rituals as part of the historical problem that has led sex relations to where they are today. If the Europeans caused a mess by overfeeding women’s love of flattery and drama, however, the extreme practicality of relations between the sexes in early America may also have contributed to the problem by underfeeding them. While game might be viewed as a kind of modern version of the European gallantries to which Beaumont refers, no amount of game expertise on the part of American men will fix our society without a fundamental shift in women’s behavior.

I always thought my mom was my best friend. I thought I could tell her ANYTHING and I usually did. It seemed so wonderful to have the love and support of a mother. It seemed amazing to go home at night and have your best friend always there. I always thought she was not passing judgement and was being supportive of my decisions. There were a few times in my life when I felt my mom was dictating too much to me what I could and could not do. I just assumed these were normal “mother knows best” situations.
I'm still seeing a counsellor to help me work through the things that are there, and am receiving support from friends I've made through the school.
But I also thought it would be neat for my great-grandkids to see what my footprints looked like.

Also, Phyllis took the liberty of posting a picture of her Kiwi Bird friend on Face Book (he arrived on Blueberry Hill all the way from New Zealand courtesy of Diane!) and Donna, being an alert sort even at the crack of dawn on a Sunday morning, immediately suggested we have a contest to decide on a name for the bird.

The new constitution ushered in democracy in 1994. Ironically, however, the ANC's model of government - based on the Leninist idea of "democratic centralism" - in terms of which party headquarters dictates to local communities whom they must elect - is causing growing dissatisfaction at local level as the municipal election on 18th May approaches.

The decisions made by the upper management are not because they “answer” to the share holders. They could care less about anyone who owns less than 15% of the shares. They only answer to themselves and the board of directors. If they were concerned about you or me, they would not give them such huge paychecks after they lay off 20% of the workers. They would not stop on the dividends , they would raise them and cut their own paychecks.

As Bloomberg reports this afternoon GMT, Simon Derrick, head of currency research at Bank of New York Mellon in London, saw an ending in which Berlin voluntarily quits the euro in order to protect the credibility of its own sovereign debt. A revived German mark would rapidly increase in value, but in a note to Mellon clients, Derrick argued that German manufacturers had coped with a strong currency in the past. Berlin might find it more cost-effective to rescue its domestic lenders than to bail out the rest of the euro zone, he said. The Slog’s Frankfurt Maulwurf would agree 100%…..as would most German voters.

I can't recall him ever saying anything positive about America, unless you include how he's going to "fundamentally transform" it. Yet even then, he is not expressing love of country but love of himself. His constant berating of our country, his perpetual attacks on this country and its citizens, and his stated intention of remaking it are not rooted in patriotism. His is not a desire to improve our system of government; he seeks, I believe quite strongly, to totally destroy it. We, who love our country, know that there are things that are wrong, that aren't working perfectly (and some that aren't working at all), that we've made bad foreign policy decisions, that we are hated by much of the world. But we don't see in that a thing to be reviled, obliterated. We see in that a country that we love, fundamentally, a system of government that might be imperfect but is by far more appealing than any other. We see the good in our country, and we believe--know in our hearts and in our souls--that our country is far more good than bad. It always has been.

Daily prayer: Father, the cares of this world often press in on us and weigh our hearts down. It’s not your desire that we carry this heavy load because You are the Burden Bearer. You use the difficult circumstances of our lives to bring glory to Yourself as You bring spiritual maturity into our relationship with You. There are many situations where we’ve been dealt with unjustly, with unkind words thrown our way. Our typical response; “NOT FAIR!” But Your pattern of returning kindness to those who were hostile toward You serves as a sterling example to us when we’re hurt by other’s words or actions. Our faith is strengthened and our character is sharpened in the torrent of such hurtful circumstances. We must commit them to You and respond in Christian virtue. We invite You to take the evil that Satan hurls at us and turn it into glorious occasion for Your power to be released and healing to take place. It is in the name of Jesus that we pray and believe. Amen.

But RENT isn'st really a musical about New York. RENT is an odd and specific style of musical about an odd and specific group of people in an odd and specific city during an odd and specific period of time and epidemic. Instead of defining a generation, I think it alienates it. Living in the city doesn't help. If it does define a generation, it's not ours, and no proximity to the location can change that. But I don't think it even defines that generation. In fact, I'd think even the people who lived in the Village during the beginning of the AIDS epidemic would feel alienated, though more by the handling of the subject than the subject matter itself.
My mother is 78-years-old, and for the first time this month, I have felt a hug from her unlike any I’ve ever experienced before. Same goes for my husband. I’ve started receiving hugs from him that not only remind me of how much he loves me, they tell me he doesn’t want to let go.
And what exacerbates a drop in oil production is that it takes many, many years for production to return to pre-war levels - anywhere from 5 to 15 years. So, in a worst case scenario of war with multiple oil producing Islamic nations involved, oil will likely reach devastating highs and stay there for several years before a return to normalcy.

The witness, Mr. Burnip, was very fortunate that he was in a location that afforded a good view of the lake.

"The movie turns on the slightly malicious question, "Who is Kim Novak?" a question which becomes more frightening, and unanswerable, once the secret of her dual identity within the film is revealed. The initial sequences, for all their beauty in summoning up the enchantment of the anima archetype, belong to a familiar-enough theme in psychology and art--the man as victim of seduction. The fall of James Stewart's character Scottie into "acute melancholia complicated by a guilt complex" is what he deserves from biting into this familiar apple. Indeed, the cumulative kitsch elements of the romance--the staginess of the exposition of the preposterous plot; the tourist's view of San Francisco's prettiness in the long, languishing silent sequence; the poor quality of the "museum painting" of the nineteenth-century woman Kim Novak is supposed to be obsessed by; the monotonous unreality Novak brings to the reading of her lines; and the ponderous earnestness of James Stewart as he becomes her victim--all have a wearying effect, much like the depression of coaddiction." - John Beebe (The Anima in Film)

I am teaching them to do their best and give it their all. If you didn’t do your best, than how will you know you couldn’t go farther? I insist on honesty, for you must be true to yourself in order to open your life wholeheartedly to others. I will support them the only way I know how, with open arms, annoying words of wisdom and a love that continues to multiply.
After about a week and a half of not sleeping well, I’ve had two nights in a row of solid sleep. Let’s all remember how important sleep is – not only because it does a body good, but also because it helps hold crazy at bay. There’s a diference between not getting enough sleep and not needing sleep. When I don’t get good sleep, and I feel like I don’t need it – that’s when I worry. This has been different… it’s more along the lines of not being able to get comfortable. Or, y’know, entering the third trimester of pregnancy. Either way, sleep has been lovely.

This is unfortunate, because—like logic—the scientific method is a powerful resource; like logic, again, there are things it can do better than any other creation of the human mind, and some of those things will be needed badly in the years ahead of us. Between the dumping of excess specializations in a contracting economy, the diminishing returns of scientific research itself, and the spreading popular distrust of science as currently practiced, the likelihood that any significant fraction of today’s institutional science will squeeze through the hard times ahead is minimal at best. What that leaves, it seems to me, is a return to the original roots of science as an amateur pursuit.

Through Twitter I have met an amazing international group of educators from around the world who constantly motivate and inspire me to be a better teacher. They have opened up a world of technology which have helped to shape my contact with students and extended it to outside the classroom through sites such as Edmodo. I have learnt hundreds of activities through #eltchat, a weekly conversation which I take part in as often as I can and have many times written summaries for. I am now one of the curators for #eltpics, a resource which I am hugely proud to be a part of (with Victoria, Fiona and Carol). I have got work as a follow-up to entering a competition I heard about on Twitter. I have also received a scholarship for the IATEFL conference in 2012, when my presentation will bring many of these strands together by being based on research about how to encourage students to use online materials. I am greatly looking forward to the TESOL France conference in Paris at the beginning of November when I will finally get to meet many of these fascinating people, a conference which I didn’t even know existed before joining Twitter.

The last long run I did prior to Nashville was 4 weeks ago. Between vacation, work, and getting sick, running was not a priority. You cannot expect to race strong if you are not training enough. Simple, right? The previous PRs and strength that I had felt during recent long runs lulled me into a false sense of security. I thought I could rely on latent fitness to muscle through. In some cases, I did – I did actually finish this thing. I just finished it in one of my worst times ever.

These last few days since I accepted the employment offer I have really been trying to soak as much time at home as I can. Whether it’s taking my time to enjoy my coffee while I play with munchkin or just spending more time with family in general. Yesterday little dude had a great day at school and decided that he wanted to spend the night with his Mimi and Papa to celebrate, which meant hubby and I got to have a quasi-date night with munchkin! Hubby treated me to an amazing sushi dinner at Pacific Rim in Sarasota. We had the Hot Lava Roll which was an inside out roll – AMAZING, the Pacific Rim Roll, and the Seven Seas Roll. Of course I had to have my order of edamame and the owner treated us to Tuna Carpaccio which was spicy and wonderful! After dinner we stopped by to see hubby’s brother and his family. We honestly do not see them enough and we only live 15 mins away from each other. Gotta work on that. Munchkin is almost as tall as her 14 month old cousin! Watching her and Cy play with each other was such a treat now that she is getting older and responding more. You could definitely tell that she was frustrated that she couldn’t chase after him, she wanted to so bad!We made it home just in time to watch Fringe which was wonderfully strange as usual. Love shows like that!

After teasing us die-hards for a few years, Arena Rock Recordings have finally seen it fit to shine a light on one such departed Dixie conglomeration, Birmingham, AL's Primitons whose small but powerful discography is enshrined on the chronological, eighteen-track Don't Go Away, compiling their '85 self-titled mini album for Throbbing Lobster Records, the Don't Go Away ep (1986) and their 1987 parting shot, Happy All the Time. The Primitons lineup, sometimes a trio, and at one point a quartet, involved a constant nucleus of guitar/keyboard toting frontman Mats Roden and percussionist Leif Bondarenko. The group boasted an advanced sound beyond sweet minor chords and tingly arpeggios, one that's hard to properly distill in the written word. The initial seven-song salvo that comprises Don't Go Away was tracked under the auspices of Mitch Easter, and whether by osmosis or whatever you choose to peg it, Let's Active had profoundly rubbed off on Roden and Co. Nonetheless the early Primitons material boasts an indigenous sonic strain of it's own, sparked by an uncanny chemistry interwoven between it's three architects, resulting in fluid, jittery jangle-pop with no shortage of idiosyncratic overtones. From Alabama you say?

There have been smaller distributors who pick up the little guys, and in a town like Portland, there was money to be made at each level. But that bucks the trend. Since 1970, the number of beer distributors has been cut in half--despite the number of breweries increasing by 1,400. It's only in towns like Portland where the volume of a bunch of smaller breweries can make it possible for a smaller distributor to make a profit. And in any case, the three-tier system collects power in the bottleneck of the distributor. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but certainly something to keep an eye on. And with the merger of Columbia and Mount Hood, something even more important to keep an eye on.

There are two planets not included here – the lunar nodes: Rahu and Ketu. These planets are huge wildcards more than they are specifically “benefic” or “malefic.”They will significantly amplify the benefic or malefic nature of whatever they planet they contact in a chart.

I've also been seeing my therapist, who is, like, total awesomeness. She told me last week that she wants me to watch the 'Hostel' movies as therapeutic homework to help me deal with my anger issues. (I may or may not have mentioned that I would love to torture and maim certain persons who shall not be named in the remote eventuality that they wind up tortured and maimed. However, I would like to point out that my religion mandates that I harm none, so the aforementioned torture and maiming would remain in the realm of fantasy and I would not in actuality commit such heinous acts in reality.) As I adore Quentin Tarantino I was all over that but they didn't have those flicks streaming on Netflix so I opted to watch 'The Killing Jar' and 'Kill Bill: Volume 1' and 'Kill Bill: Volume 2.' As I've said before Uma Thurman totally and completely kicks ass (with a sword) and I'm all over her exacting vengeance on all those who harmed her. And 'The Killing Jar' was just beyond utterly fantastic. I so have to buy that one on DVD.

Julia Donovan, a journal who will become a recurring character throughout the rest of the series, catches a tip the government has built a spaceship using alien technology. She knows enough for the president to pull strings and get the story cancelled, but in order to find out who Donovan’s leak is, SGC agrees to give her a tour of the facility and ship in exchange for revealing her source. The plan is to destroy all evidence of Donovan’s story once her source has been exposed.
Decide what it is that you want your subconscious mind to do for you, one thing at a time. If you want a particular problem solved, spend five minutes or so, night and morning, quietly realizing that the whole thing is being worked out for you on the subconscious level. Then quiet suddenly will come the solution, and it will be the right one, because the subconscious is open at its source to the inflowing of the wisdom of Creative Intelligence.
“I began to have some difficulties with my vision. I first noticed it during my summer vacation in 1970. I joined a baseball team and the coach made me play outfield. Near the third inning, the player at bat from the opposite team hit a fly ball in my direction. I didn't see it coming until it was halfway towards me. By then it was too late. I couldn't run fast enough to catch the ball. I felt extremely ashamed because I made a stupid move, permitting one of the players who were on base to run home; thereby giving a point to our opponents.”

As soon as I got out of lecture I ran over to Paul Martin's (second row middle) and had a little happy hour before going to see The Lucky One (top right) with my girlfriends. We were so excited to see this, the "new Notebook" but all had the same exclamation that, "That was no Notebook!" I think that the movie was enjoyable and entertaining but possibly not worth the theater price. It was pretty slow to get to the good scenes, you know that ones I mean, and then one scene threw the whole thing off for me. I won't say more because I don't want to spoil it for the rest of you. The important part was that I got to spend a great night with my girlfriends. That was much better than the movie itself.

Because of who I am, I'm quick to see in this only further proof of the randomness and devastation that humans are subjected to. The concept of mortality mixed with the ever present truth that it can happen at any moment. It's enough to drive anyone to insanity, or religion, take your pick. But this is a part of myself I've been trying to fight forever, this inherent notion to focus on the negative, and convincing myself the worse case scenario is inevitable.

Despite the clear conflict of interest between her lobbying clients and her philanthropic goals, Levesque and her team have led a quiet but astonishing national transformation. Lobbyists like Levesque have made 2011 the year of virtual education reform, at last achieving sweeping legislative success by combining the financial firepower of their corporate clients with the seeming legitimacy of privatization-minded school-reform think tanks and foundations. Thanks to this synergistic pairing, policies designed to boost the bottom lines of education-technology companies are cast as mere attempts to improve education through technological enhancements, prompting little public debate or opposition. In addition to Florida, twelve states have expanded virtual school programs or online course requirements this year. This legislative juggernaut has coincided with a gold rush of investors clamoring to get a piece of the K-12 education market. It’s big business, and getting bigger: One study estimated that revenues from the K-12 online learning industry will grow by 43 percent between 2010 and 2015, with revenues reaching $24.4 billion.

Good morning everyone, thanks for visiting today. A special 'hello' and thank you to my new followers. I am a very happy bunny today as my half term starts today. I am so ready for this break and looking forward to lots of crafty time and fun with Molly and Lucy; we have kites and bird houses to make and decorate tomorrow - can't wait!

I’ve used overcompensatory before, but it really is the word that best describes Jormungand thus far; it knows that Koko is its greatest asset, and though she is quite an asset, nothing else the show introduces can begin to match her level of infectious kookiness. Yes, a pair of crazed assassins known as Orchestra is shown to have a vendetta against her because she’s an arms dealer, but they’re two of the most insignificant characters introduced thus far, and that’s saying something when there are only two characters that get any sort of development. All they do is run around with a neon sign saying “HEY AREN’T WE CRAZY? WE COMPARE SHOOTING PEOPLE TO MAKING MUSIC. CRAZY RIGHT? FUCKING CRAZY, AHHHHHH!” in big bold font hovering right above them, shoot people, and swear gratuitously. It was refreshing for a few episodes that Jormungand was willing to eschew minor development in order to jump right into the action, but doing it for three episodes straight is treading over a thin line.
However, I was never really interested with the love stories. And the ending..not what I was expecting. I was slightly disappointed since the tension and the build-up was fantastic. And seeing it end that way it just felt rushed and it seemed like they just bailed out. The rest of the film was still solid though.

Brodie has been riding this same bike- with training wheels- since the moment he turned 3. We got it used so it had tons of miles on it, but that was cool with us. He loved it for a while and then the thrill of it waned for some reason. We didn't push it at all- it's not like Brodie was lacking in activities or anything. When he showed some interest again (at 4.5yr) we took him to ride 1 or maybe 2 times, without training wheels. That was Spring of 2011. Summer was too hot and when Fall hit, I think we took the time to try 1 more time. We could tell he was (kind of) getting it, but something seemed off (clue #1 or 2??). It wasn't until last month (February 2012) that he began asking to ride again. He was more determined this time, but we were having all kinds of trouble with the bike (screws were falling out, pedals were loose and uneven, etc.). Call it bad parenting if you want, but we thought he would be able to get the hang of it regardless of the somewhat broken bike. Sad. We took him out about 5 times and he could go a short distance without our help, but that was about it. I started feeling bad when, at one point, Kyle had to take the bike home to fix the pedal that had just fallen off as Brodie was riding. We finally bought new pedals for the bike and guess what??? Off he went- first try! It was a fun moment for sure and Brodie was thrilled, but I felt so bad at the same time. Why didn't we just take the time to figure out exactly what the bike needed and then make it happen....like 8 months ago? We were even considering buying a new bike. That would have been so silly and such a waste of money. I have so much to learn.
Rooney Mara and Kate Beckinsale were the first to pop in my head when scrolling through the collection.

Here in Florida, we have a hard time finding rhubarb because it's such a hit or miss thing for the grocery stores to have it in stock. I actually mentioned this to my boss's wife and two days later she came into work with a package of this delicious vegetable for me - sweetest lady EVER! Rhubarb looks like celery but is a pink color and can be found with the berries. Funnily enough, not two days after she brought this in for me, I found a larger package at Publix and bought it too. I chopped all of it up and it's been sitting in my freezer, just waiting for me to decide what to do with it. Well, now I have and I'm sharing it with you.

It may help that I’m spending two weeks on the parable of the prodigal son with my daughters. We’d been having some problems with petty squabbles and resentments, so it seemed like it might be helpful to spend a little extra time talking about Christ’s infinite mercy, and the joy we should feel when someone seeks to atone for wrongs committed. This took on a little extra poignancy over the weekend, when I received the news that my estranged aunt is dying from stage four lung cancer with brain metastases. Tidings like those tend to make all the reasons I find to hold onto anger and grudges seem even more foolish than they usually do.

Especially impressive was the acting of Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander. She won't win the Academy Award for which she is nominated, but she should, in my opinion. I think the voting members are a bit too staid and stuffy to let a newcomer like Ms. Mara win, but she embodies this role almost perfectly. I enjoyed seeing her work far more than the other nominees that I have so far seen.
Anyway, in Allonsanfàn, we follow a disillusioned, weary and aging radical, Fulvio Imbrani (Marcello Mastroianni), as he repeatedly tries (and fails) to extricate himself form his former revolutionary life. This is often to grotesque or comedic results (such as when he makes a suicide pact with one fellow comrade, only to let the other guy go first), though - as is the usual style of 1970s commedie all'italiana - it's also very sad, beneath everything. The aristocratic Fulvio stumbles out of prison one day, feverish and exhausted, narrowly avoiding a grim fate at the hands of the state. His revolutionary comrades likewise almost behead him, thinking he had spilled all their secrets. When this is proved false, he is left to mend in the comfort of his big fancy bed in his big fancy mansion. And big fancy mansions - they are hard to say no to.

One of the film’s pleasant surprises is the elegant direction of Bharat Nalluri, a British television director by trade who unfortunately has The Crow: Salvation (2000) on his resume. Fortunately, his work on Miss Pettigrew makes one quickly forget that he was ever a part of that debacle as he gives this film a classy, retro touch. He also brings a refreshing economy of style, wisely letting the actors’ performances and the well-written screenplay to do all the heavy lifting. He’s also smart enough to wrap it all up in an attractive package thanks to Sarah Greenwood’s production design and Nick Gottschalk’s art direction. The attention to period detail is fantastic, from the cars, clothes and architecture that immerse us completely in ‘30s era London. One only has to look at Delysia’s stunningly decorated apartment, or Nick’s Art Deco style nightclub, to see the great lengths the filmmakers went to get the period details just right.

Cold or wet weather does not cause a cold, but nobody seems to want to accept this. The is common cold is caused by a virus. These viruses are everywhere and it is difficult to avoid them. When you are exposed to someone who has a cold, you are more likely to get ill yourself, so be careful about close contact and definitely wash your hands. Not getting enough sleep or eating poorly can also reduce your resistance to infection. Remember that antibiotics won't fight your everyday cold. Antibiotics work only against bacteria. To take care of a cold, rest,
I am at a point in my life where I feel like I am having a mid life crisis and I am not even in my forties! I am in my twenties! But I feel like a trapped bird- one whose wings have been clipped and it is taking me some time to fly away. Life has me trapped in a sad reality where I just can no longer feel anything but sadness and conflict. Conflicting thoughts as to how I should live my life, how to carry on, how to survive in this world, how to find love and experience it. There is so much a person needs to know when going out exploring, when going out experiencing the world and they say that adversities challenge you and develop you as a person but for the past few days I have been questioning things.

Actually, I don't want to sound so certain there, mostly because I do question the content/form dichotomy. Let's amend the above to: "That's mostly content, and mostly not form." If we're going to call something "formalist", though, it should be primarily about form.
"Our young feet," they say, "are very weak!
However, there’s a phrase that I hear often that I’m tired of hearing. I want to put it out there as a plea to quit saying it and most importantly, to stop doing it. Here’s the phrase I don’t want to hear anymore: “I’m following my heart.”

“That’s nice,” the man said.

“That’s not it at all,” he vehemently insisted. “You were always so intelligent. I mean, you were a sixteen-year-old senior in high school! Just how many grades did you skip over, anyway?”
The firm of TrimTabs itself is taking a cautious stance and reducing its market exposure to zero from 50% exposure. TrimTabs’ reasoning is that the end of QE2 to spell the end of the ‘propping up of the market’. While certainly understandable, this is information that is all too well known and already priced into the market. They go on to write to their clients that the “S&P 500 is down 6.8% from its interim closing high on April 29, and we expect market action to get even uglier this summer.” Their terrible track record makes it tempting to fade them here.
Eating out in Burlington spoiled me. I could sit back and let someone else serve me my food. On Friday night we ate at a place called Sky Burger and I ate a quinoa, sundried tomato, and roasted artichoke burger. Mmmm. Saturday night we ate Korean Dancing Noodles at Duino Duende. The dish was a combo of spicy, tangy, crunchy, chewy, and sweet. I love when flavors and textures meld together, like opposites attracting. The beauty of ordering food at a restaurant is that I didn’t have to strain my brain to come up with the combinations. All I had to do was pick it off of a menu.
Allantoin – Uric acid from cows, most mammals. Also in many plants (especially comfrey). In cosmetics (especially creams and lotions) and used in treatment of wounds and ulcers. Derivatives: Alcloxa, Aldioxa. Alternatives: extract of comfrey root, synthetics.
Blumenberg contrasts the book of nature and clockwork universe metaphors. The output of the clock -- the actual display of time -- is not significant in the use of the metaphor; what matters is its predictable functioning. For the book of nature, on the other hand, the informative content is critical; what is significant in the metaphor is that there is a message that could be communicated. (71)
The first one people will notice is Drac himself. And not because it's a good performance, either. We get, instead, the most afroed, grease painted, goateed, gangly thin Dracula ever. Not that Bela Lugosi could have saved this character, but as played by Zandor Vorkov, this is the most monotone, dorky bloodsucker ever... but even at that, what do you expect from a stockbroker? Oh yeah; Zandor was the stage name for Roger Engel, the man who helped finance this movie and another Adamson flick Brain Of Blood and therefore got first chance to play a role in both...whereas he should have been given the option to turn both roles down. Not that the echoing voice helps matters; it's like listening to the guy at the drive-through practice his announcer voice whilst suffering from adenoids.
Speaking of books, I read the book Hick a several years ago. Now I see it is coming out as a movie. I may need to revisit that book if I still have it. I guess, it didn’t impress me on first read. I was really surprised to see it is coming out as a movie. Maybe because my initial take on the book was that it was going to be more about Nebraska, but ended up being about something totally different.

Instead of a group celebration back at home, we plan to enjoy the people in our life individually, in a way that reflects our personal relationship with them. We’ll have more time to visit with them, share our feelings about our new life and how much we will continue to value them in it, and savor the togetherness. We look forward to a first wedded year filled with these small-scale celebrations.
Below is the old cherry tree that split the lilac in half last year. Can you tell my heart is still broken over that lilac bush? Well, it is. My husband has been cleaning up the tree bit by bit but has been sidetracked by the poison ivy. He’s got it up his arm; nothing too bad we think.

I am sure you have all by now heard about the sad demise of Whitney Houston and yes, she almost had it all, except she was apparently a lost soul whose life was overtaken by drink and drugs. What makes this happen and how can we try to stop it….or can we?

In 1949 Gilbert Ryle published The Concept of Mind, one of the most important books of philosophy of mind of the last century and probably the best manifesto of philosophical behaviorism. Although today few would endorse Ryle’s strictly behaviorist semantics of psychological predicates the book continues to be persuasive as a sustained attack on what Ryle calls “Cartesian” theories of mind. Specifically Ryle challenges the ancient intuition that the word “mind” refers to some one, unanalyzable thing. He does this more thoroughly (and in a grander style) than anything I can do here, but he wrote at a time when the practice of metaphysics was out of favor in the English-language philosophical world. Today we enjoy the benefits of the “language” philosophy that was done by the early 20th century empiricists and the benefits of the revival of metaphysics, which has been to some extent motivated by the emphasis on philosophy of mind, of the past several decades.
Oh Friday...Thank you for finally arriving! I missed you so much! This week was long...ever so long...but Cinco De Mayo is going to bring yummy burritos & tons of Sangria! Woohoo!! Can't Wait! What is also really cool is that Saturday is going to be what scientists are calling a Super Moon! If you look for the moon on the horizon right as the sun is setting and the moon is peeking forward it will appear larger than the life & bright as anything! It makes me want to watch "Moonstruck" for Cosmo's Moon. hehe...Actually because it's a full Moon no wonder this week was so crazy!! =)
So don’t get it twisted.
The number one market for all this crap jewelery seemed to be middle-aged women from Luzon. Every single one of them were covered head to toe in metric shit tons of cheap sparkly Chinese bling like a protective exoskeleton of awesome sparkly over tight, black, fetishy clothes. Like the officers' uniform of a disco spy unit, or really short extras from The Road Warrior. I have no idea what this is about, but it was a welcome treat for the eyes. Other than them, the people watching was kind of dismal, unless you had some kind of weird interest in old white people, which I do not.

This might not have been a problem in the pre-social-media age, but marketing these days, particularly for new writers, is focussed so much on engagement with potential readers that it presents a real issue. I just don't have enough knowledge of the genre (sub-genre?) to engage with these people.
Once he was in Mexico a mob saw him, but since he had a burrito they decided to give him a sombrero instead of being hostile to him. Then he ended up on a boat (ok, so I told this story awhile ago. I don’t remember WHY he got on the boat.). While in the boat he dropped his burrito overboard. When he didn’t have his burrito anymore, the mob became hostile again and through Mark off the boat. In the process Mark cut himself on a sharp piece of metal protruding from the side of the ship. Because of the cut, he was eaten by a shark when he fell into the Gulf of Mexico.

Last Sunday, my pastor challenged my understanding, and opened my eyes to a spiritual truth in that simple story that I need to meditate on daily; that if I really grasp it, will change my every moment from here on. (You can listen to his sermon here: http://wlachurch.org/resources/WLA_560.mp3 but finish reading my blog first!)
Ba Conaing. ba Cuilini,
Neither Tish or Buddy get him in quite the same way I do, so while I let most of it roll off, it pushes their buttons in a hurry (A response, alas, that he doesn't mind cultivating -remember that Kit is a drama queen). The comment above notwithstanding, some of his wit is really quite funny and quick off the mark. But I can understand getting pissed off if you're looking for a kid to get ready for school and you get a smart aleck remark instead.
Normally, such summits are relatively friendly affairs dealing with trade issues that are settled more or less amicably and end with the usual platitudes and photo-ops. Not this time.
Her performance here proves every doubt I had wrong. Looking back, anyone else playing Jade would have been, well it just wouldn’t have been right. Daisy brings Jade to life in a subtle, very understated performance. I could go on about how pleased I was with Daisy’s performance, but in short, she made Jade feel like

I got into conversation with a man in a pub recently and he posed the question: ”Apart from London where else could you take a beautiful woman?” The answer was “York”. He made an excellent point. York is an outstandingly beautiful and interesting historic town. It has a medieval town wall you can walk along and a fabulous Minster.
Also, remember her? The construction date is scheduled for February 15th!
If the marketing budget for your company is relatively tight but you are looking for more ways to get your message to would-be customers, guerilla marketing tactics are a great option at your disposal.

Industry leaders are voicing skepticism about new office development in Brooklyn and Queens, however. As one real estate banking officer put it: "If these projects did not happen when the market was hot as a pistol, I don't see this going to happen over the next couple of years. Who is going to pay the rents for the new construction in these locations?"
