The second suggestion is having the Illinois Commerce Commission consider eliminating cost increases for people who don't choose to take advantage of the smart meter technology. That is a very disconcerting idea. Smart grid development and smart meter deployment is a multi-billion-dollar, 10-year infrastructure project. When we all chip in to build other infrastructure projects -- like building a better road or extending the reach of public transportation -- everyone pays to have the project built and various groups benefit in different, sometimes unequal ways. In addition, people who do nothing will still reap the benefits of an upgraded system even if they don't choose to take advantage of smart meter opportunities.

Metro State (25-25) has won eight of its past 10 games. The sixth-seeded Roadrunners are ensured at least two more games in the double-elimination tournament, but they'll need a longer tourney run for Tillery to likely have a shot at the all-time Division II record of 28 home runs in a season set by Carmen Paez of Florida Gulf Coast in 2007. Tillery has her eyes on the Metro State single-season record of 25 homers.

My biggest quibble was how well-done many of the meats were. Flank steak and lamb chops were pink and succulent. A bone-in rib steak was juicy and terrific on our second visit, but the same cut was overcooked on a busy Saturday night. Leg of lamb, sirloin steak, filet mignon chunks wrapped in bacon and a parmesan-crusted beef tenderloin all were well-done.
It took me many years. I used recipes from many vaunted cookbooks and baking experts, and my stupid cake never came out right. It came out sunken. It came out soggy. One cake managed both.

Keep in mind that these surveys can be dicey. Good pollsters want to interview only the people who will really turn out, and that's much harder to discern in a caucus than a primary or general election, because a caucus requires so much more of the voters. A trip to the polls takes a few minutes; you can even vote by mail. But a caucus in one of Iowa's 1,774 precincts can easily mean spending a couple of hours in a gymnasium on a wintry January night.

Both talked about the chain of custody of evidence — needles, syringes, gauze and other items — some of which McNamee says were used to inject Clemens with a steroid. Clemens' lawyers focused on the condition of the evidence when it was handed over to authorities by McNamee, emphasizing a photo of the items bunched in a bag with a beer can rather than the photos of the items neatly arranged for classification once they were in the hands of the IRS and later the FBI.

Speaking of cash, Leap Year should be good for investments because your money has an additional day to accrue interest. If you have a $5,000 CD at today's standard 1 percent rate, you just earned about 13 more cents. Of course, that'll be quickly wiped out by having to pay for another day of heat and electricity. And who decided that Leap Day should be in February? Was somebody feeling sorry for it because it was already the shortest month? If they would have awarded the spare 24 hours to June, we could have an extra day to keep the swimming pools open every fourth summer.
Unlike other schools, where teachers input attendance data into a centralized computer system, Veal had teachers take attendance on paper attendance forms.

Snook, a defense attorney in Charlottesville who has been blogging about the case on his firm's website, is close to Lawrence and understandably a bit pained to criticize him.

PBS's Idea Channel posted an amusing YouTube commentary recently asking the question: Who's more authentic, Lana Del Rey or Hatsune Miku? The latter is a computer-generated avatar, and the conclusions weighed in "her" favor. Trying to be something you're not - that's inauthentic, surely. But what if the music you want to make is unavoidably anachronistic? Thankfully, in an iPod-shuffled age, the temporal connection of most musical eras and genres is moot, so an album like Jill Barber's latest, "Mischievous Moon," can be unabashedly imitative and utterly honest. A stirring cocktail of Patsy Cline and Edith Piaf, this Toronto-based vocalist simply moves forward from a much earlier point of reference, building on 1960s lighter-than-air orchestrated jazz-pop. Her honeyed voice glides through romantic reveries ("Chances," "Never Quit Loving You," "A Wish Under My Pillow") and the occasional bold step (the gospel 'n' vibes of "Oh My My"). Around every satin-cushioned corner, she gives us an irony-free wink. (If she'd have sung "Zou Bisou Bisou," no one would have laughed or squirmed.) "Mischievous Moon" could have come out 35 years ago instead of this week, and it would rate as highly either way.
That day has arrived and it is taking over our tiny yard. We need to prune it, but I'm a bit in a quandary about the best approach. I've been pruning roses for years, so I have an idea about shaping, etc., but would really appreciate some tips.

Remember how Russell Westbrook torched the Blazers last season, making Andre Miller look 50 while averaging 27 points, 8.5 rebounds and 6.0 assists in four games? Well, now the Blazers have Felton, whose speed -- both offensively and defensively -- neutralizes Westbrook just enough to take away a huge advantage. Westbrook still got his Tuesday night -- 22 points, six rebounds and eight assists -- but nine of the points were late and much of his night was spent trying to beat Felton, not the Blazers.

The rites that we perform help to create our sense of identity. It's true on the level of family: my family has a sung prayer that we learned from my grandparents. Now, when we we gather with my parents on holidays, my mother leads the singing. Each time I sing that prayer my sense of identity in that specific family is strengthened. The same thing is at work in church. When I participate in Christian tradition I feel a bond between myself and Christians not only around the world, but through time. I remember what my family name really is, and where I belong. There are competing allegiances at work in and around us all the time, telling us that we are first of all Americas, first of all employees, first of all consumers. Those allegiances are promoted through liturgy and tradition, as well: through songs, ceremonies, symbols, holidays, even advertising that creates a shared sense of identity. The liturgy and traditions of the church remind us again and again of who we are "first of all" - citizens of another Kingdom, servants of the King.

Andy Griffith applies a thick layer of aw-shucks back-country charm to his portrayal of Georgia hillbilly Will Stockdale, a U.S. Army draftee, in this knee-slapping 1958 comedy. What Stockdale lacks in sophistication, he makes up for in basic common sense, to the eternal frustration of his put-upon sergeant. Based on Mac Hyman's novel, the story was also turned into a long-running Broadway play and a live TV broadcast and clearly influenced the 1964 CBS sitcom "Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C." Look for Don Knotts in a small role. Black and white, unrated, 119 minutes. No DVD extras. From Warner Bros.

On Thursday, he seemed to backtrack a bit, saying “Every game is its own entity. Certain turnovers, you can’t couple them all together. That’s where you get in trouble. If somebody tips the ball and the other (team) catches it, is that the quarterback? To me, you have your gut feeling (about when to pull your quarterback).”

"When the opportunity arose to lead a microfinance organization, it really resonated with my values. Since I've been in the position I have seen how central it is that these women clients are at the center of the industry. They're investing the proceeds of their entrepreneurial activities into intergenerational poverty alleviating -- getting better education for their children and health care. I never tire of hearing people's stories of the impact even such minimal amounts of capital have. Often, it's required to succeed that someone takes a chance on you, to give you a leg up. And these are people no one has given any support in any kind of formal way. To have microfinance provide them with that kind of opportunity is a powerful moment in their lives for these women."

Over the past 10 years, most Americans have had extensive personal experience with the TSA, and this familiarity has bred contempt. People often suggest that the U.S. should adopt the "Israeli method" of airport security—which relies on less screening of banned items and more interviewing of passengers. But Israeli citizens accept the continued existence of a common enemy that requires them to tolerate necessary inconveniences, and they know that terror plots are ongoing.

The courts have repeatedly rejected Arizona's arguments that the law isn't an attempt to interfere with federal authority to regulate immigration but rather an effort to work cooperatively with Washington.

Gartland and Foley face charges of conspiracy, money laundering, theft by deception, making false representations for a government contract, falsifying or tampering with records and forgery.
The Blazers are going to spend a lot of time in the next couple of days trying to explain away the 46 turnovers in their last two games. Coach Nate McMillan called it, "playing in a hurry." He's concerned. Maybe it's a lack of conditioning. Maybe his players are trying to play loose and free too soon. Maybe this is what you get when you shorten a season. Whatever. Figure it out. Because the slop has to stop.

Dark beers aren't the only ones that make memorable dessert pairings. I love the aromas of banana and bubblegum that come from the German yeast used in traditional hefeweizens ("hefe" is German for "yeast"; "weizen" means "wheat"). They're refreshing summertime beers, but that doesn't mean they don't play well with desserts.

"It's going to be a little rivalry of its own," Upshaw said.

The only question is how to balance the city's interest in keeping streets safe and clean with the U.S. Constitution's protection against unreasonable seizures of property. The homeless often carry the things they own with them but sometimes must leave them briefly unattended while eating, bathing or meeting with social workers. That shouldn't give the police license, however, to seize and destroy those belongings, which could include identification, medication and other important personal effects. That's why Trutanich should stop fighting the injunction and negotiate a compromise with people who have no other place to store their possessions.

"This is probably as difficult of a case as I have seen," defense attorney John Fitzgibbons said. "The court proceedings today were very emotional and sad. Mrs. Rodriguez could not have been more compassionate or shown more dignity than she did in this case. Everyone involved in this case is a casualty of war. Capt. Sciple was a normal individual when he volunteered for the Marines shortly after 9/11. He came back a changed man because of his war injuries."

Then, suddenly, the Chinese Foreign Ministry put out a simple statement on its website. Mr. Chen, it said, could apply to study abroad like any Chinese student, as long as he followed procedures.

I was really tempted to stick with the Lana Del Rey parody theme, especially since I finally just read those “Hunger Games” books. Instead, I thought I would balance the scales a little bit. You see, I love “Skyrim” with all my heart, and it's hard for me not to mention that fact in every post. However, it's not a perfect game. Sometimes it's a hilariously weird game.

Patel warned taking action against Haley would open up other lawmakers and businesses to similar claims of unethical behavior. To find otherwise would not only impugn the integrity of other members of the General Assembly, but also that of many of South Carolina's best corporate partners: BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina, Michelin, AT&T, Time Warner Cable, and several others, she wrote.

The dusty market hums to a hundred voices, a mishmash of Chinese, Mongolian, Russian and English.

My fond pizza memories go back 70-plus years when we would visit Grandma and Grandpa Valente in New Haven, Conn., during summer vacation. These would have been my 5- to 13-year-old years. The highlight of each week was going for pizza at The Spot restaurant on Wooster Street, in the heart of New Haven's Little Italy. We sat at a long table in the alley alongside The Spot, with strings of bare light bulbs hung above us between the buildings. Often, I got to sit next to Grandpa. I am not positive, but I think the pizzas were delivered whole, for Grandpa to cut and hand them off to be passed around the table. The wait for the pizza was made bearable by eating fresh clams on the half shell. And we kids were given small glasses of half-and-half wine and water. In my late teens, I had a touch of "been there, done that" pride when I learned that The Spot had a reputation as one of the birthplaces of pizza in the United States. --Richard Ellers, Warren

All of it has to be matched and explained."

I met her on the gangplank of Noah's ark. I did not agree with her on a lot of things. Like Sinatra, I've gotten more conservative as I've gotten older. But not Molly. With the awkward grace of a child of our times, she clung to her ideals and notions and hopes, riding against the wind in a state as red as the blood of a dying cowboy. The word I'm looking for is "righteous." Righteous without being self-righteous.

now, there is celebration in Anaheim. The Los Angeles Angels, after missing the playoffs the past two years, have had a major overhaul this offseason. A front-office shuffle brought in Jerry Dipoto as general manager, and a winter spending spree included the signing of 31-year-old Albert Pujols to a 10-year free-agent contract. Check back in a couple of years. Will they be pouring champagne over Pujols' head at Angel Stadium four or five years down the road? History doesn't bode well for the Angels, who have a lengthy list of free-agent nightmares all their own. Does the name Mo Vaughn ring a bell? After six consecutive seasons of MVP consideration in Boston, he signed a six-year, $80 million deal with the Angels before the 1999 season.

Most of these photographs, though, are simple illustrations in pop colors that end up exemplifying the taste for vulgar riches they are supposedly satirizing: The assumption by art photographers in the U.S., Europe and Japan—that one should strive to make pictures full of barely contained energies, testing the limits of the medium itself, either in formal or philosophic terms—does not seem to have firmly taken hold yet.

In a recall election, there is no primary. So my opponents put up Jerry Lewis, by design a nominal Republican, against me. In a normal election, he would have had no chance in the primary getting the Republican nod, and with a registration edge to GOP voters in my district, I would have won easily against the Democrat in the general election. They knew that. However, the Democrats did not put up a candidate. Instead, they and left-wing groups supported Lewis.

I'll give you one final example of the differences between us and the Republicans, and that's on the issue of tax cuts. Under the tax plan passed by the last administration, taxes are scheduled to go up substantially next year. Now, I believe we ought to make the tax cuts for the middle class permanent. These families are the ones who saw their wages and incomes flatline over the last decade – and they deserve a break. And because they are more likely to spend on basic necessities, this will strengthen the economy as a whole.

The biggest question we face is whether we are now safer after all the efforts our nation has put forth over the last decade. I am not so sure; politics aside, I believe we should not have gone to war in Iraq. The terrorists responsible for 9/11were based in Afghanistan and we let our attention be diverted to a different front. In the process we lost so many lives on both sides. We lost the huge amount of support in the world which had been generated after 9/11. This anti-American sentiment was very high, and has slowly started to improve. Unfortunately so much good that our government and public do for the world is lost due to these negative feelings found around the world, and especially in Muslim countries. Millions of dollars which are donated for different calamities in the world fail to register on the radar of an ordinary person, as the images from the war fronts are much stronger. Previously we commanded a great deal of respect from people all across the world and it will take a much longer time before we can regain it.

A mirror ball complemented the dreamlike qualities of Mexico and a handful of other serene selections. The only other stage prop was a redbud tree that was awarded to a fan after an extraordinarily odd exchange. Cake doesn't need special effects. When he wasn't offering droll banter, front man John McCrea acted as a frantic band director and vibra-slap fiend. Cake's prominent use of the percussive instrument is akin to Blue Oyster Cult's association with the cowbell. The noirish textures and funk flavors played by guitarist Xan McCurdy and the fastidious contributions of trumpeter and keyboardist Vince DiFiore are also essential elements of Cake's distinctive sound.

This sleek spot with the cocoa-colored walls bills itself as a bar and bottle shop, but the menu demands staying for more than a cocktail. Start with the duck rillette, a slow-cooked mound of melt-in-your-mouth heaven served with vaguely sweet pear mostarda. Dry-aged New York steak arrives perfectly pink, but it's the enormous, salty corona beans surrounding it that make you want to plant a beanstalk so those beauties can be part of every meal.

But, at the same time, we have to keep in mind that medical research is constantly growing, so it is no surprise that certain tests and techniques fall under scrutiny and beg for improvement.

The legendary Mjolnir appears to be made of stone but was actually forged by Dwarven blacksmiths from a magical metal called uru. It has many enchantments, such as the ability to create storms and lightning. If thrown, it always returns to the hand of the thrower, and, in early comic versions, Thor flew by simply hurling the hammer and holding onto the handle. It can also open dimensional portals, perhaps explaining Thor's return to Earth after the bridge connecting Asgard and our world was destroyed in the 2011 film. And, of course, you can hit people with it very hard. Perhaps the most telling of all Mjolnir's enchantments is that it is virtually impossible for it to fall into evil hands. The hammer can be lifted only by one who is worthy.

Dutch caretaker Prime Minister Mark Rutte, whose government broke up after budget talks collapsed, is struggling to pull together enough support from the parliamentary opposition for crucial austerity measures ahead of the new elections. The deadline is tight: the Netherlands is expected to detail how it will meet the EU's rules requiring most countries to meet a deficit of 3% of gross domestic product by the end of this month. It currently has a projected deficit of 4.6% in 2013 if no cuts are made.
The fare cards are last-resort housing. "Most homeless people, at night time they sleep on the train," explains Conrad Burnett, 22, who sometimes does that. "It's an hour and half, two hours from 95th to Howard, back and forth and back and forth. It's warm on the train. You get used to it, sitting up sleeping. You gotta hold all your bags.

Over the last five years, the federal government has required discounts for pediatric orphan drugs used in hospitals that serve a number of low-income families. While it did not give subsidies to the drug makers in return, the discount program was viewed by lawmakers and drug makers as part of the broad drug-regulation and pricing universe in which Congress allowed patent exclusivity for some medicines, and offered subsidies through other programs. In exchange, the drug makers provided discounts in the range of 30 to 50 percent.
Hand-tossed crispy scallion pancake? You're going to want one (it is crisp as advertised), as well as at least one order of the Salt & Pepper Crispy Cake, which is a pingpong-ball-sized baked dumpling with a pleasantly glutinous filling. The slightly cloddish noodle soups? Maybe not. A smoky glass of plum juice, just the regular kind you can buy in any Chinese supermarket but somehow intensified into a Scotch-like presence by the sweet food, is what you want to drink.

Things get a little more patchy after the pizzas. We tried the Barley Platter ($14.99), a staggeringly large plate of seven appetizers, with mixed results. The waffle fries and sweet potato wedges were crisp and delectable. The Reuben Egg Rolls, stuffed with Swiss, corned beef, cabbage, onions and potatoes had sat too long in the fryer and tasted mostly of oil. Meanwhile, the bruschetta had sat too long somewhere else and had a soggy bottom as well as a damp flavor. The Chicken Tenders and Wings, with an amazing and amusing (13) number of sauce options, were decent -- but I didn't understand the appeal of the Pretzel Bites, which amounted to Kraft cheddar-food-filled soft pretzel slugs. All of these starters are available individually ($2.99-$7.99).

As some of us have predicted, the real issue at stake in the health care debate is whether we still have a federal government limited by the 10th Amendment -- a system under which the powers not specifically granted to the federal government (such as the regulation of interstate commerce) are retained by the states and the people themselves.

This postseason run could be the last hurrah for Bartschi and Rattie in Portland. In last June's NHL Entry Draft, Bartschi went in the first round to Calgary with the 13th pick, Rattie in the second round to St. Louis with the 32nd pick, and it’s possible that one or both will end up sticking in the pro ranks next season.

Whether it makes sense or not remains to be seen when we play on Saturday. . We didn't think we were going to be able to play 11 players in three games this week. We have to rotate some players."
But in another sense it's not odd, because telling voters that they have to pay high gas prices in order to ineffectually fight climate change would be honest but incalculably dumb, politically. Recent polling shows that Americans care about the economy more — a lot more — than global warming. Skepticism about the existence of a problem or its scope has been rising in the U.S. and Europe. When a Pew poll in January asked voters what their biggest priorities were, climate changed ranked second to last. Only obesity was deemed less of a priority. (Don't tell Michelle Obama.)
The consensus is that it's working, with polls showing President Barack Obama leading Romney by double digits among women. Romney is certainly acting as if he thinks it's working -- doing defensive events with women, brandishing his winsome wife, Ann, as a shield from attack, and jumping all over a condescending statement by Democratic operative Hilary Rosen about how Ann, as a stay-at-home mom, "never worked a day in her life."
Hard as it is today to imagine a time where Dimora was a political underdog, in the early 1990s, he was an outsider, a man with whom many weren't quite comfortable.

Healthy communication, however, isn't an end in itself. No matter how much our regional leaders talk with one another, they have to figure out a way to generate jobs.
Better than our new health care law would have been reforms such as medical malpractice overhaul -- to help lower soaring health care costs -- as well as other cost-containment measures. We should remove the middleman (employers) from the health care equation entirely, leaving individuals to purchase their health insurance. America needs to get consumers closer to their health care bills and give them incentive to be realistic about their medical expectations by moving away from employer-provided coverage.

A. The length was pretty organic. We wanted to allow the people to talk, not just about a focused part of their life, but to revel in their language, their cadence. I wanted some sections to be quite long, like a short story.

If you've been living in this country at least 15 years, odds are you have a T-shirt collection. Odds are also that you can't remember where half of them came from, although, thankfully, it's usually spelled out for you in chunky type. I was in a volleyball tournament? I signed up for that credit card offer? And really, what fashionista in the Bay Area wears your standard men's T-shirts? They're big, they're boxy, they're shapeless -- in other words, terribly unflattering.
Council is currently 3-2 Republican.
Another Republican governor who had been on the same Vietnam trip, Henry Bellmon of Oklahoma, was also chairman of the Nixon for President Committee, and he helpfully denied "any indication we were misled or brainwashed in any way." It fell to a Democrat, the perpetually caustic Sen. Eugene McCarthy of Wisconsin, soon to seek his party's presidential nomination, to observe about Romney's vulnerability: "I would have thought a light rinse would have done it."

Carm's Coneys. Costa Mesa (Irvine and 17th) authentic New York-style hot dog stand owned by Upstate N.Y. transplant Carmen Cimini. It's located at one of my favorite intersections in Orange County.

The Hyatt Regency St. Louis Riverfront, formerly known as the Adam's Mark, recently kicked off a $63 million renovation, which it says will be done by July. When it's done, the 910-room hotel at the corner of Chestnut and 4th Street, will have three new restaurants - a Ruth's Chris Steakhouse, a Brewhouse sports bar, an a grill-style restaurant called Red Kitchen and Bar. It'll also have an 18th-story observation area and new meeting space overlooking the Arch and Mississippi River. They'll also add 52 suites and redesign all the rooms.

Steill uses her consignment/sales money on holiday gifts, which is added incentive to get rid of things throughout the year.
Deerfield management consultant Brad Schneider, 50, is a much better fit. He has experience working for big companies and running his own, and he has a long record of service to community organizations in the district. He's taken some heat for donating to some of Republican Mark Kirk's congressional campaigns, but this is a bogus complaint. It's a testament to Schneider's independence that on other occasions he contributed to Kirk's opponents. Federal Election Commission records suggest Schneider has found common ground with a wide range of candidates — Nancy Pelosi, anyone? — just like the voters he'd represent. Schneider is endorsed.

"Detroit has just gone through one of its periodic episodes of promising to save itself. Michigan's Republican governor, Rick Snyder, has announced a 'financial-stability agreement' by which a nine-member advisory board will be entrusted with seeing to it that the City of Detroit amends its wicked ways. If you have ever known a junkie, you know how this story ends: Promises are made, and sometimes even kept for a while, but sooner or later, the needle goes back into the arm, because the seldom-spoken truth is that a junkie wants to be a junkie. And Detroit wants to be Detroit."
Ohio also offers "open enrollment." This requires all private insurance carriers in Ohio to open a certain amount of their business to those with pre-existing conditions. The premiums are generally higher than those in the high risk pool but they are capped by the state.

"My girls all season have battled back from behind," Howell coach Steve Moorman said. "We've won numerous one-run games. As long as we had a chance to bat, I knew we had a chance to score."
Another problem with premium support has attracted less attention: It reintroduces insurance companies into a system that currently functions just fine without them. Premiums would have to cover not just the cost of care, as now, but insurance companies' administrative expenses and profits, "limited" by the Affordable Care Act to 20 percent of revenue.

At Zephyr Cove Lodge, 28 cabins sit only a few dozen yards from the lake. Our cabin could sleep six, easily, with a large master bedroom and upstairs loft. Especially useful were the fully functioning kitchen and large gas fireplace in the living room, both of which came in handy during our stay. Next to a large general store, which doubles as the registration desk, is the lodge's restaurant and bar, with wide windows allowing for lake views and a surprisingly abundant menu.

The results must be filtered a bit, too. The Cardinals played in the Super Bowl the previous season, meaning their selections came near the bottom of every round. That's an obvious disadvantage.
The stock market's big rally to kick off the year has already surpassed many stock strategists' 2012 forecasts. Now, some say the market is ripe for a pullback before it can push higher.
“New Jersey’s voters will have a very clear choice if Senator Kyrillos becomes the Republican nominee- Senator Bob Menendez who fights every day for middle class New Jersey families or long-time Trenton insider Joe Kyrillos- who sides with corporations and special interests over working families and seniors and panders to the most extreme elements of the Washington Republicans," Lawrence said in a statement.
Earlier this month, Oden had an arthroscopic procedure in Vail to clean out debris in his right knee. That knee was the original injury that delayed the start to his NBA career after he had microfracture surgery on it, sidelining him for the entire 2007-08 season. Oden was the No. 1 pick of the 2007 NBA draft.

Descended from French brothers Louis and Pierre Pellier, who are said to have brought the first Pinot Noir grapes to California in the 1850s, Steven Kent Mirassou belongs to one of the longest-established winery families in the country. Mirassou's two wineries share the same space, but the wines are distinctly different. For his eponymous label, small lots of Cabernet Sauvignon are the specialty; while Pinot Noir, sourced from vineyards throughout California and Oregon, is the focus at La Rochelle. Two tasting options are available: $10 for four pours in the Barrel Room or sample four wines, paired with hand-selected cheeses in the Reserve Room ($20).

Jurors returned to Common Pleas Judge Dick Ambrose’s courtroom this week for the sentencing, or mitigation, phase of the trial. During this stage, defense attorneys call witnesses whose testimony could humanize Sowell in the hopes of persuading the jury to spare him the death penalty.
This is the bicentennial year of Charles Dickens' birth. We need no reminder of his eminence as novelist, but there are celebrations of his other attainments as well. "The Selected Letters of Charles Dickens" is part of that. As its editor observes, a 12-volume edition of letters already exists; it took from 1965 to 2002 to compile the British Academy Pilgrim Edition "The Letters of Charles Dickens." Although in September 1860 the writer made a bonfire of personal papers in a field at his house, Gad's Hill, some 14,000 missives survived. The Pilgrim Edition contains them all (newly discovered letters have been published as supplements in the journal the Dickensian); this new edition of selections amounts to a "mere" 450 examples of the master's epistolary prose. None but the librarian or obsessive devotee of Dickens' work need thumb through all 12 volumes, but many will want this smaller edition to own. Its annotations are useful; its print is — for these eyes, at least — too small; it offers the author writ large.
Dec. 9, 1977: Kermit Washington punches Rudy Tomjanovich in the face:

A 10-year-old refrigerator, for example, uses twice the electricity of a newer model with an Energy Star rating. And you'll save more than $30 a year on your electric bill if you replace a pre-1994 dishwasher with an Energy Star-qualified new one. You might even want to replace older appliances even if they're not acting up.

We even got a couple of fish casting crank baits along a seawall where the water was shallower and we could get some shelter from the icy wind.
Interesting that they would reveal the man arriving by helicopter is Kalon and not (as the preview would have you suspect) Bentley. Other things that caught our eye - there's a race car driver, one guy goes by "Wolf," there's a 41 year-old (can you imagine a 41 year-old woman on "The Bachelor"?) and there's a party MC named "Stevie."

The prayer helps calm the room before the pre-game meal. Even though the hotel has cranked out the best of its menu — grilled chicken, rice, pasta, salad — the coaches are too nervous to eat.
No complaints about cheesiness could be heard. A live band played while TV screens showed the red-carpet show in Hollywood. Drinks flowed. A silent auction featured items like a signed picture of Miley Cyrus to raise even more money for the commission. Everyone left with an Oscar-shaped cookie.
Many players are on record as saying they would feel “lost” without Long’s guidance. High praise indeed, but right now Long is as essential to the Yankees aura as the first inning roll call or Sinatra’s “New York, New York.”

One of his findings, he said, is that "ads that attack Obama too personally turn people off in ways that will keep them turned off."
Instead of focusing on Albert and his contract, perhaps we should think about the needs of the vulnerable members of our community and those who work with them. I'm thinking about those living in poverty, the homeless, the mentally and physically challenged, victims of abuse and neglect and other froms of violence. Of course, worrying about Albert and his contract is easier than thinking about these individuals. While Albert and other professional athletes entertain us for the duration of a season, a large cadre of dedicated people work daily providing needed services to our vulnerable neighbors. The case managers at agecnies like Places for People/Community Alternatives help people deal with the challenges of everyday living. Volunteers provide pro bono counseling services to victims of torture and war trauma. Staff and volunteers run after school programs for at risk youth. These are but a few examples. The critical work of these people goes unnoticed. Service providers employed in public and private agencies continure to work for wages that don't begin to reflect the importance of their contribution to the welfare of the St. Louis community.
While Park increased its sales last year, the company kept its costs low. Expenses grew by 14 percent, slightly less than the growth in sales. Keeping costs low helped Park expand its profit margin as its markets improved.

However, Wilson is far from alone in thinking that the prohibition in the House bill doesn't go far enough. For him and other Republicans, the problem is not what's in the bill, it's what the bill leaves out. There's no provision for how the prohibition would be enforced, or any requirement for people to prove they are citizens or legal residents before getting health care benefits. In fact, Democrats on the Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means committees defeated Republican-offered amendments that would have required people to verify their legal status before getting care, with some Democrats saying such requirements would be unnecessarily burdensome for people legally entitled to coverage. Wilson cited the defeat of those two amendments Thursday when he discussed his outburst with reporters.

It is sadly inevitable that I will read more headlines of U.S. soldiers killed in foreign countries. What possible rationale is there to keep troops in Afghanistan or Iraq?

For Kaplan, the cultural analyst, the melding of the worlds of politics and celebrity is a process that's gone hand in hand with a redefining of the kind of people we want our leaders to be.

But in an interview during a Fox networks party a few weeks earlier, Sutter, who also has a blog, seemed pretty clear about why he's on Twitter. "I find it useful as a tool in terms of staying connected with the fan base.

The wines of the Daniel years were very much classically styled Napa Cabernet: picked at moderate ripeness, fermented in upright wooden vats, aged in mostly old wood casks. They were made with few of the modern techniques that seem mandatory nowadays, and yet many of them have endured through the decades, showing the sheer quality of the Niebaum vineyards and the volcanic and bale loam soils in the heart of Rutherford.

That's not to say HMOs by themselves are the answer to rising healthcare costs. The healthcare industry is still figuring out how to encourage efficiency without limiting people's access to the care they need. In other words, there's still a risk that "managing" care from the insurer's perspective will lead to rationing and a loss of patients' ability to control their own destinies. State officials say Brown's proposal is designed to guard against both of these problems, but the issue has to be taken seriously.

This slippery perspective makes Chihiro feel like she is "inhabiting someone else's dream." Falling in love with Narajima, a man burdened by his past involvement in a destructive cult, also changes the way she sees the simplest things. "It was so gorgeous it almost felt like sadness," she writes of their love. Later, she notices that the lake they visited together shone more beautifully when they were in love; she admits that "the lake has all sorts of different faces." "The Lake" is about the layering effects of time, the lacquer that suffocates the childlike self. It's about the importance of change, of movement and new ideas: "When you're in a state of homogeneity," Chihiro thinks, "it means you've lost yourself."

Let’s face it: more money does not necessarily lead to a better education. Today, in Newark, we spend $23,000 per student for instruction and services. But only 23% of ninth graders who enter high school this year will receive high school diplomas in four years. Asbury Park is similar: per pupil costs, at almost $30,000 a year, are nearly 75% above the state average. But the dropout rate is almost 10 times the state average. And math S.A.T. scores lag the state average by 180 points.

It is a sorry state of affairs when Wall Street reacts to Standard and Poor’s downgrading of the U.S. government. What standing does S&P have in the credit rating world, when it was so clearly exposed for its active participation with brokerage houses in the mortgage scandal that brought down the U.S. economy? Its rating is suspect at best, but Wall Street is using that as an excuse for Monday’s market collapse. The downgrading of the U.S. government is a permanent scar on this great country’s standing.

Wood slats taken from the Market Hall in Hercules are also used in the food court to hang art made by local artists. Concrete rubble is being used to help build planting beds, benches and a retaining wall.

They are diligent in their quest, willing to be led by the presence of God.

So far this season, if Felton and Crawford aren't turning the ball over in bunches, they are missing shots like a fan during a timeout promotion. And if they are protecting the ball during the first three quarters of the game, they are coughing it up in crunch time.

As much as I love that story about Dom Pérignon, we now know it's just a myth. He didn't invent the process for making Champagne nor say anything about drinking stars. However, one thing is true. The magic of tiny bubbles rising in a flute of sparkling wine continues today. And luckily for those of us living in the United States, we can experience the traditional technique used in Champagne in our own country, particularly in California, the largest domestic producer of sparkling wine.

Feves' earthy sculptures of the 1940s and 1950s reflected her most basic experiences as both a mother and as a resident of the arid eastern Oregon landscape. She repeatedly turned to the female figure, depicted as hulking and sensuous by way of Picasso, while images from nature crept into her formal vocabulary: slabs and stones, stalks, pods and flowers, which are likely a further abstraction of the female figure. For Feves, both motherhood and the eastern Oregon wilds offered practical but purposeful metaphors for the creative life, modeling invention and growth close to home.

Barcelona, Spain: Where the locals resemble Javier Bardem and Penélope Cruz, nobody goes out to dinner before 10:30 p.m., and the streets teem with so much fantasy-fueled Gaudí architecture it leaves you breathless. It's easy to succumb in a city that has a beach lapping its southeastern edge, where even the ham — procured from black-hoofed pigs fattened on acorns — is a sensual experience. Start the day at Mercat de Santa Catarina, eyeing ripe figs and fleshy peaches. Then slip into Cuines Santa-Catarina and devour oily sardines and garlicky bread smeared with succulent tomatoes. Afterward, siesta at Hotel Omm, where the minimalist aesthetic won't get in the way of your own Gaudí-inspired fantasies.

Hey, Tony: I think the Browns, assuming everything magically works in their favor, should draft Justin Blackmon at No. 4 and Michael Floyd at No. 22. Although it would be risky, if one works out the team would be in great position in the future. If both work out ... well that'd be a Browns fan's dream! Then 2013 can be used to find a QB (if necessary), and at that point the next QB or McCoy would be working with established NFL wide receivers. -- Kyle Chormanski, Los Angeles

Comment: Anger is versatile in the sense that he uses a wide variety of punting styles. He's capable of executing both Australian-style and rugby kicks that should help him angle punts toward the sidelines inside the 20-yard line. One downside of these methods, though, is an occasional lack of height on kicks. He tends to drive the ball more than loft it, which could lead to some shanked kicks at the next level.
At the conclusion of the Persian Gulf War, he headed the international relief efforts for the Iraqi Kurds who were pushed into the inhospitable mountains along the Turkish border by Saddam Hussein's forces.

And I'd hate to see that taken away."

There’s also a lot of scream-and-break-stuff theatrics. Of course, this is the third movie opening today (after “The Town” and “Leaves of Grass”) directed by one of its stars — and the worst at giving in to stop-the-show, look-at-me performing.
Productivity is another major force reshaping manufacturing. As factories have grown more high-tech, they have also grown more productive. In the two decades leading up to the Great Recession, labor productivity in manufacturing roughly doubled. But of course, higher-tech factories require fewer workers. Even as output rose 65 percent, labor hours fell 20 percent, and a total of 3.7 million jobs disappeared in the decades leading up to the Great Recession. But thanks to our increases in productivity, we remain a very competitive manufacturing nation.

Meanwhile, there's no sign that another key element in the GOP budget will advance this year. It's a tax plan promising sharply lower rates in exchange for eliminating many popular tax breaks. The GOP tax reform plan would lower the top rate from 35 percent to 25 percent, but at the risk of eliminating deductions on mortgage interest, charitable contributions and state and local taxes. It's simply too controversial and difficult to do in a hyper-polarized election year.

2008 Woodenhead Naturale Russian River Valley Sparkling ($42, 11.6%): This Forestville house is staging a French Colombard revival with its Halfshell White. Now it's gone fizzy - though whether a Champagne-style Colombard earns this price tag is a buyer's decision. Edgy and super-lean, almost evoking a dry sparkling Chenin Blanc, like a Vouvray Brut. Dark stone and ripe apple, with a slightly earthy character. No surprise: oysters (or even a light dashi broth) come to mind.

The International was without question one of the two or three best golf events in the whole country.

Such tastings  and rankings  are subjective and unscientific. For instance, to "pull" a great espresso takes both skill and a bit of luck. But the discerning barista will pour out a poor espresso and redo the pull until a good or very good one is realized. We considered the body or mouthfeel of the coffee, the aroma, the complexity of pleasing flavors, as well as the finish. A great espresso takes seconds to drink, but the flavor coats the mouth and should last for some time.
Dolan, a married father of four who turns 57 next month, has long hinted he would step down when his second three-year term expires.
That video also questions whether Romney would've made the same decision -- repeating his comments from 2007 in which he said it wasn't worth spending billions "just trying to catch one person."

The club will continue its six-game, 10-day road trip Saturday in Winnipeg. It may be without defenseman Kris Russell, who left in the third period and did not return. His status is not known yet.
“One of the things that interested me was how this story dealt with the way we do things we don’t want to do, and we even know aren’t good for us,” says Affleck, 38. “It’s hard to change, and having that kind of self-knowledge while you’re still doing things you know are harmful — that’s a very interesting thing to play.”
"From 2004 till now it's been a frantic domestic sprint," White explained. "The hurricane hit Pensacola in 2004 and destroyed the town and did a lot of damage to my house, and my ex, right in the middle of it, told me she was sick of this place and was moving somewhere else with my daughter, so I had to desperately fix my house up and try to sell it and then move to Athens and live in an apartment and look for a house and buy a house and renovate a house and get married and have a baby. It was a landslide of stuff. It's just been a desperate scramble, and I'm just burning the last of the garage, and after that there's not much to do."
Meskan said strike force investigators are allowed to attend one training program annually and three attendees, including himself, did not attend one in 2008, so they could go to Hawaii.

But Rubin's involvement has not gone unnoticed. Late last year, Ohio's attorney general filed a lawsuit in Hernando County to force Rubin, a resident of Weeki Wachee, to answer questions and turn over documents in connection with that state's investigation into the Navy Veterans. Though three other attorneys retained by Navy Vets agreed to be deposed, Rubin cited attorney-client privilege. In February, a Hernando County judge ordered her to comply.

"You can't win if you don't have a kicker," former Green Bay quarterback Zeke Bratkowski told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. "It wasn't called 'throw the ball' or 'run the ball.' It was called 'football.' He worked at it. It wasn't easy. Green Bay is cold. But he made so many clutch kicks."

But unlike the Ritz or Silo Point, Pier Homes did not have certificates of occupancy. Either way, the head of the independent panel that reduced the Pier Homes values said he cannot believe that the assessments agency would treat one of its decisions as a precedent for other properties.
Lindsay, who says he's "not a fan of the show," says the home was indeed listed for $1.495 million last year but taken off the market. Because of the maintenance issues mentioned before -- the roof and the furnace haven't been replaced since the home was built in 1989, the pool has issues -- he listed it at $1.095, an aggressive price, he says, in a "tough segment of the market." You mean high-end real estate, or homes owned by notorious real estate stars?
When one of those nine-pointed models finally satisfied McVey, he asked for a full-scale plywood model. Kubin and the other carpenter built the 34-foot high wooden star on the ground, then they measured that model to calculate the dimensions the stonecutters should use. In the end, it turned out that not one piece of stone in the strange star would be set either plum or level. But it worked: From the ground, it seemed just right, as inevitable as Jesse Jones' will.

The rookie trio had just learned they had made their first NFL roster. They quickly became close friends, hanging out with each other away from the locker room. With training camp and the preseason finished and the team hotel no longer available, Cox and Vaughn moved into a Lone Tree apartment in September 2010. Thomas, who was still shopping for a place, would frequently sleep on an air mattress in the apartment's living room.
The current to do over airline screening simply obfuscates the intent of this administration to form a “powerful, strong and well-funded civilian force equal to our military” – his words not mine. Why he digressed from his prepared remarks to posit such a stunning declaration is a mystery, undaunted hubris perhaps. Nonetheless, having moved the TSA from the Department of Transportation, as originally designated, to the Department of Homeland Security signifies the objective, a civilian security force. Thus, broadening the scope of their activities beyond simply transportation.

But when the game ended, the night turned ugly. And without warning, Sowell began choking her so hard tears poured from her eyes.

Take off your clothes!"
Truck driver Jaime Musso, 53, thought his truck was being buffeted by strong winds and by the time he saw the overpass hanging down over Highway 5 there was no chance of stopping, so he aimed for the spot where he thought he would cause the least damage and brought down the overpass onto his truck.

Katy Perry recently took "Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)," a song with a brief saxophone solo, to the top of the Billboard charts. Lady Gaga enlisted Clarence Clemons, the Big Man himself, to play on "Hair" and "The Edge of Glory." These records won't make you forget about "Jungleland," but they do suggest that the sax prohibition on mainstream radio is easing a bit. Now in the year of the modest saxophone revival, Romanian dance-pop singer Alexandra Stan arrives on these shores with "Mr. Saxobeat." The song has already hit No. 1 in several European and Asian countries, and it’s making a beeline for the U.S. Top 10.
"I don't want a donation from Councilman Cimperman. I need him to just get the legislation passed and make it a little easier. This is ridiculous," Whalen said.

"We feel we are facilitators of something that has public ownership," Saliba said. "We don't think anyone should own the event. We don't think that's what Last Thursday is."
In this age of foreclosure, which followed an unprecedented age of home ownership, the very notion that says everyone can get their own piece of the American dream is up in the air. But is that necessary to make a house a home?

That's the way it's going to be. While special teams rarely win games by themselves, no matter how dominant (see: 2004-08 Bills, 2009-10 Browns), it's important to note that bad special teams can submarine a season (2010 Chargers).
Once again, though, the legislature wants to fix a system that isn't broken. Missouri's selection system has consistently produced distinguished judges who have served the state and the public well. Recently, the Supreme Court passed rules aimed at increasing transparency in the selection process. There is no reason to politicize judicial selection by giving the governor unilateral power to control the commission through his appointees.

In February 2008, the county sued the deputy sheriff's union in a landmark effort to erase the expensive "3 at 50" formula for police. The county argued that the pension plan violated state law because retired public safety employees were paid extra compensation for work they had already done. The county also argued that the plan was illegal because it spent general fund money without voter approval.

Frusciante's departure wasn't publicly known, and it was hardly the band's first season of turmoil. The original Chili Peppers quartet of friends from Fairfax High was shattered by the 1988 heroin overdose of guitarist Hillel Slovak and the grief-stricken exit of drummer Jack Irons. Those next years saw a series of comings and goings, including one player who threatened to burn down Kiedis' house, and an uneasy period with Jane's Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro. All of it swirled around the creative core of Flea and Kiedis, who ultimately found their greatest, most lasting successes with Frusciante and Smith.

In Portland, Ore., is the easy answer. With a filmmaking husband and two children. But how she got there is at the heart of "Wild." She literally walked there more than 15 years ago, with nothing to call her own except a creaky backpack she named Monster that weighed half as much as she did. Her feet blistered painfully, she lost six toenails and developed palm-sized calluses on her hip bones that resembled a cross between "tree bark and a plucked dead chicken."
Rather than mope before heading home, though, Pam Nordin said, "It's a bummer, but we're still going to celebrate. Mike's still turning 40, so we'll have breakfast, get dry and go to his son's violin concert."
There is no one more tired of the endless debate than the residents of the area where the plaza is "alleged" to be built.

Wang, a junior at USC, said he hopes the university will follow through with the security enhancements.

Her improved play is due, in large part, to a strong work ethic.
But her answer surprised me. She cited a simple bowl of noodles as one of her favorite things to eat in New York City: "The place is sort of a dive, but they make this incredible bowl of noodle soup, kind of like Thai tom yum, but with loads of seafood and tomatoes, like French bouillabaisse. It's in no way authentic or fancy, but I could eat it every day."

He played last season in the UFL for the Omaha Nighthawks.
Some top aides argued that gay marriage is toxic at the ballot box in battleground states like North Carolina and Virginia because, as Tuesday’s vote proved, the issue remains a reliable way to fire up rank-and-file Republicans. It also could open Obama up to Republican criticism that he was taking his eye off the economy, voters’ No. 1 issue.

Deep ecology says the living environment as a whole has the same right as humans do to flourish. In contrast, "shallow ecology" fixes on short-term technological answers to environmental concerns.

McDonald's will also face rising costs in other areas. It said it expects an income tax rate of 31 to 32 percent for the year, up from the 29.3 percent effective tax rate it paid last year. It expects interest expenses to rise 8 to 10 percent in 2011, based on current rates. Also, McDonald's employees are staying longer, which leads to higher pay. So labor costs have increased slightly.

Mammography technology has improved enough that many hospitals and screening centers have replaced traditional mammography equipment with digital mammography, which stores images in a computer instead of on X-ray film.

Whether you are Joe Thomas, who went to the Pro Bowl, or a first year player a year ago. We all need to improve to get where we need to be. I'm actually looking for improvement from everyone. For the older guys, it's more familiarity with the system. For the younger guys, it's obviously development beyond that as they become professionals."

All these songs were performed at Tuesday's show, which kicked off a two-night stand and was presented in-the-round, with two small stages connected to a big one in the middle of the arena floor. There was still plenty of room in the setlist, though, for more innocuous material like the yearning power ballad "When You Look Me In the Eyes," the goofy novelty song "Year 3000," good-time anthems "Live to Party" and "That's Just the Way We Roll," and a bouncy cover of Neil Diamond's "Sweet Caroline."

The heart of the St. Louis region has struggled to recover for decades. The city has been unable to stop a 60-year population slide, seeing an 8 percent drop in the last decade. And St. Louis County dropped by 2 percent, falling to under 1 million residents. But the decreases were offset by the rest of the region, with 13 of the 16 counties in the metropolitan area showing growth. Only Calhoun County fell into the loss column alongside the city and St. Louis County, with a 1 percent drop.
In an attempt to decrease errors and improve patient safety, the new standards restrict the consecutive hours a first-year resident may work without sleep, from the customary 30 to 16.

Those who favored the callous aggravations of the recent Guy Ritchie-directed "Sherlock Holmes," a film without which "The Three Musketeers" would be unthinkable, may forgive the grating, chaotic brand of storytelling and filmmaking here. The director, Paul W.S. Anderson, brings to this costume party the same battering-ram sensibility he brought to "Alien Versus Predator," and the "Resident Evil" franchise. The 1844 Dumas adventure classic is now a steampunked migraine. Clashing swords, purloined jewels and court intrigues no longer suffice. This movie exists for its digital airborne sailing vessels and retro-futuristic flamethrowers.

Maher, who is married, leaves his wife and marries Merrill (but couldn't be bothered to divorce his first wife first). They settle in Elmwood Park and try to have a baby before Maher realizes Merrill is "not mother material." Merrill finds work dancing under the name Danielle at Satin Dolls in Hackensack -- we're guessing that Kipps got the location wrong; Satin Dolls, the stand-in for the Bada-Bing in "The Sopranos," is in nearby Lodi. (There's the inevitable "Sopranos" connection!) Maher discovers Merrill is cheating on him and eventually leaves her.

Undefeated's focus is on Courtney, then, waxing profound as he steers his minivan to practice sessions and games. It is also on three of the Tigers under his tutelage: Montrail "Money" Brown, a smallish but resilient offensive lineman and one of the few teammates getting good grades in class; Chavis Daniels, a hotheaded running back, just out of a youth penitentiary; and O.C. Brown, a fleet-footed, 315-pound right tackle who's already on the college scouts' radar, but whose shaky test scores may keep him from advancing.

As for me, Im going to keep wearing my helmet when I go-karting or car racing. I have to, anyway. I think Henry Ford might have been the last driver to run without a helmet of some sort when he drove Sweepstakes to victory in Grosse Pointe in 1901, winning enough money to seed his Ford Motor Co.
McCarthy has never been in a majority, in Sacramento or Washington. His 13-member freshman class elected in the dreadful (for Republicans) year of 2006 was the smallest cohort of new Republicans since the House was expanded to 435 seats in 1913. But he favors running the House in a way that would dilute control by the majority's leaders, of which he is to be one, and would make life sweeter for the minority: He thinks every member should be empowered to offer amendments to spending bills. That expresses his view -- which also was the Founders', although they did not put it this way -- that "the Senate is the country club, we are the IHOP."
Opponents don't believe the figures. They noted that the casino amendment does not give a timeframe for when the casinos will be built, and without all four casinos, the encouraging job and tax collection figures will fall well short of expectations.
Crafster.org bills itself as the hip, alternative crafting site. Here you can browse through member forums about anti-Valentine's Day crafts and DIY home furnishings, such as a hanging light fixture made from empty yogurt containers.

But you can always add a comment or question if you can't find information.
The Heat turned it over on their next possession when Chris Bosh's pass sailed into the backcourt, and Anthony was fouled by Shane Battier attempting a 3-pointer.

The death of Robinson, 19, of Blaine, became a high priority for state and federal lawmakers. Though federal authorities argue that 2C-E was already illegal under a federal law banning drugs that are chemically similar to illegal drugs, U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar has introduced legislation specifically banning the substance. State legislators also made the drug illegal, along with its chemical cousins. The drug is a powder most often compared to Ecstasy, creating upbeat mood swings and high energy.
But because these are superheroes with super powers, they also have super egos. And so a great deal of time is spent having them talk trash and square off against one another to prove who's toughest. Though they might seem like filler, these showdowns let each character have his or her time in the spotlight, and they build some genuine tension. They also represent the adolescent fantasies of every geek in the audience. So in theory, everyone's happy.

Because PCT levels tend to fall in direct response to the level of infection, the test is also often used to see if a patient is responding well to a treatment.
Plus, the Blazers felt they had taken their best shot with Miller, and it couldn't get them out of the first round. They worried about his defense, and how much mileage had been put on those tree-trunk legs. And they worried about his spotty outside shot, and how that, coupled with Marcus Camby's limited scoring skills, tended to bog down the offense.

“Separation of church and state are one of the basics of our country.... The more religious you are the more you should want to keep the separation, because someday the religion that the state picks as the 'state religion' might not be yours. The way to solve that is to not have a state religion.”
The equalizer never materialized and the host Friars held on for a 2-1 win in the CHSAA girls soccer state semifinals Saturday afternoon in South Huntington.

"He was awesome," Stevens said Sunday after the Kings practiced at a rink outside St. Louis. "He was a great mentor."
(In response, the MPAA has released a statement that can be described as "hysterical," creepily insinuating that every site that's joined in on the January 18 blackout protest should be investigated by the government for antitrust violations. I am now seriously suggesting that Jack Valenti's old office be evacuated until environmental inspectors can examine the MPAA's suite for some sort of gas leak. I suggest that they wear hazmat suits with independent oxygen supplies.)

And Luke Winn, who did the hoops rankings, wonders how Michigan will adjust to losing its best perimeter shooters: "To best fit his personnel, how far will John Beilein tilt his offense away from the three, and in favor of attacking off the dribble, or pounding the ball inside to Mitch McGary and fellow power forward Jordan Morgan?"

When I and other reporters crowded around executives such as General Motors Chief Executive Dan Akerson at the auto show, I was able to turn on the audio recording app and push the tablet toward his face instead of the microphones that others used.
Listen carefully to today's Republican right and you hear the same Social Darwinism that Americans were fed more than a century ago to justify the brazen inequality of the Gilded Age: survival of the fittest. Don't help the poor or unemployed or anyone who's fallen on bad times, they say, because this only encourages laziness. America will be strong only if we reward the rich and punish the needy.
"I saw part of what he said," Payton said. "And specifically, I don't know that he made mention of that directly to me. That being said we take his office really seriously and the role he has.

UCF coachGeorge O'Learytried to challenge the offense, surprising Bortles by asking him to run the no-huddle, two-minute offense late in the first half and going for it on long fourth down situations.
It is true that the governor’s budget makes deep cuts to public education and local governments, especially in larger urban areas. And it is true that the current state operating budget which covers fiscal years 2010 and 2011 passed under former Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland and expires on June 30, made just $50.5 billion in appropriations. It marked the first time in more than four decades that an Ohio biennial budget actually spent less than the previous budget.

"At that time of year, there's so much to look at from the boat - sunfish, pompano, redfish, turtles. It's a magical time," he said, smiling at his impromptu sales pitch. "They should hire me as a spokesman."
Robertson's pairing of Strauss' final masterpiece with George Crumb's 1984 "A Haunted Landscape" was at first glance puzzling. It proved inspired. If "Four Last Songs" reflects a peaceful acceptance of life's end, "Landscape" sounds like a struggle with Death personified, experienced from within.

The restaurant, with its concrete floors, red checkered table cloths and fresh air pouring in, has a Wine Country feel and possibly the most pleasant view of any inland restaurant in Orange County, capable of ratcheting down the stress a few notches even before the wine arrives.
Smith's attorney, Weiss, said Plog has filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy and that if his motion is granted in a hearing scheduled for later this month, his debts would be wiped clean.

But his modest output did include one truly remarkable building: the Austrian Cultural Forum, a knife-thin, 24-story tower that opened in 2002 in midtown Manhattan as an outpost for exhibitions and discussions about Austrian culture and politics. Abraham's design for the Forum prevailed in a competition that drew entries from 226 Austrian firms -- essentially "every born Austrian architect who could walk," as Abraham put it at the time. It called for a tough, unforgiving piece of architecture: a 280-foot-tall, 25-foot-wide building squeezed between taller neighbors on East 52nd Street. Abraham famously compared its sharp-edged facade to the falling blade of a guillotine.
The defense might be more shaky than the offense. OSU ranked eighth in the conference last season, allowing 407.9 yards per game, and returns only four starters. One, senior safety Lance Mitchell who was in Los Angeles alongside Riley, believes the unit will improve.
Pitmaster Rodney Muirhead recently moved the barbecue joint named for his grandfather deeper into Northeast Portland. The reasons were easy to explain -- he gets to own his own building, far bigger than the train-car-sized space on Northeast Prescott (where Pok Pok Noi is now). He expanded the beer list and built a full bar. He bought a bigger smoker. The reasons to visit the new spot are also obvious: It's still the most authentic and best Texas barbecue in the area -- white bread and jalapeno optional.

California voters will be getting a breather on June 5, with just two state propositions on the ballot, on term limits and a tobacco tax. Each fits the reasonable standard for an initiative: It's an issue the Legislature either cannot or will not address, and neither adds a burden to the general fund.
Like Minnesota, Tampa Bay also got back into the first round, at No. 31 after dealing with Denver. The Bucs took Boise State running back Doug Martin.

A media adviser for al-Maliki disputed claims that the vice president was being targeted for political reasons and said the government does not interfere in the judicial system.
Finally, with the Hawks in total panic mode, Johnson dribbled too close to the sideline, got pinned and turned it over. The Celtics took off the other way, with Allen delivering a pass to Mickael Pietrus for a reverse layup with three-tenths of a second remaining. Just like that, Boston had sliced it to 66-64 heading to the fourth. The road team, cheered on by thousands of green-clad fans sprinkled around Philips Arena, kept it going early in the fourth, pushing out to a 73-69 lead on Allen's three-pointer with 8½ minutes remaining.
The only difference is that rooting for a team is, or should be, a civic endeavor. It's not about an individual. The Cardinals will always be more than any single player, more than Albert Pujols, or even more than Stan Musial for that matter. They are a common thread that for more than a century has been a rallying point for a community. And that's a good thing.
Life on Earth is messy and bloody and constantly evolving and transmuting and guess what? So is sexuality, and love, and connection, and what it means to exist. And if you uptight, hairless bipeds don't soon acknowledge this in a very profound way, well, it ain't the damn penguins who will suffer for it. You feel me?
The state classified tortoises as threatened in 2007, the year entombments ended. Last year, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said that, though the species is at risk of extinction, the agency doesn't have enough money to declare it threatened, as well. And federal wildlife-protection law is significantly more powerful than Florida's.

The blanket rule, he said, would prevent jailers from accidentally not searching someone who is concealing forbidden items like weapons or drugs. And, Phillips said, such a rule would be "designed to make sure that it isn’t someone like Mr. Florence who is going to be poked" with a shank or knife smuggled into the jail.

The board appeared to tie most of the recall problems to consumer products chairwoman Colleen Goggins, who oversaw the company's McNeil Consumer Healthcare unit before retiring earlier this month. Her total compensation fell 12 percent to $6.5 million for the year. Still, the board did not level any direct criticism at Goggins, instead praising her "distinguished career with the company."
A My mother was a piano teacher, and my first teacher. When I wasn't at the piano myself, I often sat on the stairs listening to her teaching, taking in the strains of Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Chopin. My mother was a remarkable woman, insatiably curious about music. It was she who first introduced me to modern music. I remember one birthday her gift to me was the scores to Stravinsky's "Firebird," "Petroushka" and "The Rite of Spring." She never stopped exploring, and that certainly rubbed off on me.

Mr. de Maizière arrived in Brussels at 8:30 p.m., leaving only a few hours to reach a deal before markets opened in Asia. He set out Germany's hard line. In addition to overturning all the commission's main points, other countries would have to agree to beef up the euro zone's fiscal rules. And Spain and Portugal, which markets saw as potentially the next Greece, would have to adopt fresh austerity measures.

"They are the ones who apply federal immigration law," Bender said. "If they take the position that Arizona law interferes with the operation of federal immigration, I would think that should be very persuasive with the judge." Bender said lawsuits filed against state and local governments by the federal government are not unusual but are more common in cases of civil rights issues than immigration. The U.S. Supreme Court, at the request of the U.S. solicitor general, last month agreed to hear arguments on the constitutionality of Arizona's 2007 law that penalizes employers for hiring illegal immigrants. That law has been upheld in U.S. District Court and the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Word of Tuesday's lawsuit brought out politicians and activists to condemn and praise the federal government's action.

He notes that the success of high school and college wrestling has produced a couple wrinkles that may be bleeding the field for the Senior Nationals. For one thing, a second high-profile event has popped up to compete with the Senior Nationals for top wrestlers. Another factor is the change in the way colleges recruit top high school talent. With colleges signing more recruits earlier, wrestlers who don't need to catch the eye of college coaches are sitting out the tournament.
A: I think it's a number of things. I think certainly our location plays a lot into it. I think our city tries to work with our businesses and be very business friendly in our approach. Our location and the services businesses receive really attract employers.
If you're looking for the safest places in Mexico, Yucatán and Tlaxcala states had fewer than 1.5 deaths per 100,000 population for the four-year period through 2010 — comparable to Minnesota and Vermont.

Those about to snap through a soul dog for the first time inevitably order the restaurant's signature, an all-beef frank topped with a few spoonfuls of collard green-cucumber relish, streaks of sweet potato purée and crumbled bacon. It's a complementary collection of flavors: The shards of salty bacon temper the relatively sugary sweet potato purée; the clever collard green-cucumber relish cools the still-steaming hot dog.
"I felt a singular honor," said Donovan, who scored a string of '60s hits, including the era-defining "Sunshine Superman." "I've had awards before, for writing and for ecology and poetry. But this one, I realized, was worldwide.

With flavors like Raspberry Truffle, Cotton Candy and Burgundy Cherry, Storm Bros. Ice Cream Factory has never had a problem luring walk-in customers to its perch near City Dock in downtown Annapolis. The 35-year-old shop's location in one of Maryland's most heavily visited tourist areas has mostly been a blessing, says owner Svienn C. Storm — a line of eager patrons often snakes along the sidewalk outside the shop on a sunny afternoon.

Obama's shift back to the economy ended a week dominated by his public embrace of gay marriage.

M&T participated in a program in which U.S. banks make loans to international companies to buy American goods. The international companies make loan payments directly to the financial institutions.

Eventually, the organization's new football hierarchy will reset the roster. Their biggest piece in the rebuilding effort will be the No. 2 draft pick. The difference between No. 2 and No. 5? Elite pass-rusher Da'Quan Bowers, superb cornerback Patrick Peterson and stout defensive tackle Nick Fairley may be there at No. 2 but don't figure to make it to No. 5.
"There's evidence on both sides of the coin," said Robert Balfanz, director of the Everyone Graduates Center at Johns Hopkins University and a leading researcher on school improvement.

In case you haven't noticed, conservative lawmakers are a majority in the Missouri General Assembly. Many follow the agenda of the American Legislative Exchange Council, promoting states' rights, gun rights and other right-leaning causes. The council has pushed 'stand your ground" laws like the one in Florida cited by George Zimmerman in his killing of Trayvon Martin and related "castle doctrine" laws that provide an extra measure of immunity for people who use deadly force in alleged self-defense.

Everyone is on notice from the league. The problem for the league though, is everyone has noticed the double standard as applied to the Penguins by a league that was silent when Lemieux, coolly detached two days after an event, attacked the operation but reached into Tortorella’s pocket for $20,000 when the coach, white hot 20 minutes after an incident, did the same.

Walsh, 59, is viewed as a steady hand for troubled institutions.
“Here it’s a free-for-all” she said, citing that data obtained through CISPA could theoretically end up in the Department of Defense or in the hands of the National Security Agency. Preferably, and this is something that Jeschke agrees with, the Department of Homeland Security, a civilian agency, would be the sole recipient given control of the data.
"Kyle's been around for a while now. He's played a lot of football. Our defense was going to have a challenge stopping their passing game. We knew with Moreno being injured they were probably going to have to go the pass a little bit more and Kyle, he's doing a good job."
Several factors could see the early promise fizzle. The play could turn out to be smaller than expected. Plummeting gas prices, already at record lows, could make extraction unprofitable. And environmental concerns could slow or stop production.

I've only touched the surface about the story. The hardships some of the performers endure during other parts of their daily lives are also reflected in the piece. There was a saying we used to have in the Air Force (and all branches of the military), affixed to many barracks walls: it was "Kwitcherdambellyakin". Most of us here have nothing about which to "belly ache".

They definitely personnify all people can be and achieve...when given the chance to do so.

Budweiser will get two minute-long spots in the game's middle quarters. Both focus on the beer's long heritage, one set at the end of Prohibition and the other catapulting through the decades since. They come on the heels of news that Coors Light last year overtook Budweiser in sales, and at a time when A-B says "stabilizing" its flagship brand is a top priority. Taken together, the ads tell a story of a beer that has been part of the fabric of American life for eight decades.

It's good for younger, less-traveled players and those living more of a sheltered existence, to gain the cultural experience of going to another country, of visiting areas hit by the 2011 tsunami and connecting with families of storm victims.

The shakedown aspect of the scandal is an old one: Government officials of all stripes target contractors for campaign cash, because they're the most likely to contribute, and contribute heavily. It's not against the law, but it's sleazy, and it contributes heavily to the perception that the fix is in with government contracts.

"Must be a heck of a bridge if it can be ruined by a couple of hundred men," muttered Capt. Howard Vanderluis. But the engineers won their argument, and the Army shuffled on to the bridge after the manner of a bread line moving toward the soup. Then there was the matter of the rivet. The rivet was given to Edward Stanley, the man who drove the first rivet in the bridge. With Ed Murphy, another member of the pioneer riveter crew, "bucking it up," the rivet was slipped into place. As hundreds cheered, Stanley turned loose with his trusty rivet gun. But the gun was designed to hammer steel and not soft gold. Fine pieces of gold rained into the faces of the spectators. When riveter Stanley took his gun away, the entire head of the golden rivet fell off and disappeared. Then he punched the remainder of the rivet and that, too, disappeared. So they finished the bridge with a steel rivet.

Also, there's precedent in this state for Floridians using the constitution to ban things that are already banned. (See gay marriage.)

�The tax would be difficult to enforce. While the bill excludes surgery used to correct deformities stemming from an injury or disease, the distinction between cosmetic and reconstructive surgery isn't always clear, says Dr. Phil Haeck of Seattle, ASPC president-elect. For example, a nose operation to clear an individual's airways wouldn't be taxed, he says.
8. Sprinkle in kitsch. Finally, Mellino likes to add a tiny bit of kitsch for interest. She used stones that say "gratitude," two amber turkey-shaped serving dishes and pumpkin-shaped salt-and-pepper shakers. White pumpkin-shaped salad plates also added whimsy and cemented the theme. Just be careful; more than a dash of kitsch can be overpowering.
The Pinball Hall of Fame is owned by a pinball acolyte — the nickname for true believers is "pinheads" — named Tim Arnold, and it's a sort of time capsule of the nation's pursuit of pleasure.

The characters in Chinese for Hakka mean guest people. The Hakka had lost their homeland north of the Yellow River in the third century A.D. to invading nomads. They eked out a living, farming the poorest soil, or were ultimately driven in desperation to the sea to found colonies in Taiwan, the Philippines, Singapore, Borneo and Southeast Asia. So the story about a branch of landless Hakka people  to which my mother belongs by an extenuated 1,400 years of history  came to the United States in 1851. Could other Chinese have come before the California Gold Rush by this direct route?
Total hedge-fund assets surged to $2.13 trillion at the end of the first quarter, beating the previous high of $2.04 trillion, set in the middle of last year, according to Hedge Fund Research Inc.

The measure reflects a compromise suggested by County Councilman Mike O'Mara, D-Florissant, between sprinkler organizations that promote the idea and homebuilders who oppose it. O'Mara recently said mandating sprinklers has some unknowns, such as cost and whether sprinkler systems require a separate water line. County Executive Charlie A. Dooley considers O'Mara's idea a good compromise, Mac Scott, his spokesman, said. Bills to revise other codes, such as building, property maintenance, electrical and plumbing codes are expected to be introduced next week.

For, despite the upbeat music, this is a dark tale where the artists themselves destroy their dreams. Lawrence's nicely turned performance as Curtis, the manager and producer modeled after Berry Gordy Jr. and Quincy Jones, makes this most clear.

The idea of a suicide barrier is completely moronic. It will not prevent one single suicide. People who have made the decision to commit suicide will simply seek and find another venue.

If there was ever an award for the most improved defenseman, he'd be one of those guys.

Even with these creative detours, there's no denying the strong French vibe provided by owners Jocelyn Bulow and Marc-Henri Sempere. Their experience in the food business also informs the service. The waiters understand the menu, what's offered on the cheese plate, and know how to treat customers.

So in the back half of the season, the Buckeyes actually need to run more than they did in the first half. The Illinois game, which saw the Buckeyes gain 211 yards on 51 carries, was actually the right idea. With Mike Adams back at left tackle for the last two games, and Dan Herron back as the starting running back last week, Ohio State is more equipped to make that happen.

The generously sweeping spiral staircases do not stop at the top of the loft, but add to the magnificence by giving access first to the walkway and then continuing up another level to side galleries that lead into and overlook the apse. A crucifix (the rood) surmounts the walkway across the top of the loft. Following the 20th-century reforms of Vatican II, the principal altar stands beneath the wide supporting arch, which serves visually as a proscenium. Angelic heralds as supporters emerge from the angles of the arch.

øThe qualifying relative must have gross income of less than the amount of the personal exemption. This income test prevents a lot of parents from claiming older adult children as dependents because even a part-time job will render the child ineligible, Durkin says.
BGE workers, many of them hired from out of state, who were sent to repair lines and do cleanup are not the ones to blame. They are working people doing their best. The problem is the executives who pocket millions in compensation each year yet still want to pass along the $90 million bill for post-Irene cleanup to BGE customers already burdened with some of the highest utility bills in the country. There is also nothing good about BGE/Constellation execs hiring out of town workers when 25 percent of Baltimoreans live in poverty and 21 percent of us are unemployed or underemployed.

There was a sense last season that Taveras' bat was ready for the next level, but his baserunning and fielding lagged behind. He'll start this season at either high-A Palm Beach or Class AA Springfield, and it will be his all-around performance this spring that determines that. The Cardinals believe he should be at least average on the bases and good enough in the outfield to play center at times.
Tonya Hobbs' older daughter stayed with Hobbs' relatives and is not missing.

What makes sense: Communities that don't want gambling shouldn't be forced to have it. But places that do should have that option. Personally, I enjoy visiting casinos — but I don't want one in my back yard. If I did, I would've moved to Vegas. There are, after all, obvious quality-of-life downsides when casinos come to town. That's why lawmakers should tread slowly. They should have a well-thought-out discussion about where we really want gambling — and where we don't. And then we should stick to it. Otherwise, we are left with our current policy of pretending like gambling is outlawed, even as more of it creeps across the state.
Russo, who is cooperating with the prosecution, faces nearly 22 in prison after pleading guilty to 21 corruption-related crimes. Earlier this week, he testified that he had asked Terry to deny the motion and expected the judge to do so in exchange for the campaign assistance.
"Combat changes everybody," he says in a quiet voice. "It gives you a new outlook on life: 'Wow, time out, life is short.' I realized that I need to try to experience as much as possible and that having someone that truly loves you is more important than thousands that just appreciate you. It's made me want to enjoy life more."

The dial that controls playoff intensity is an unusual one. Just when you think it's turned up all the way, it will get turned up some more.
Both parties know full well that they will need a bipartisan pact on financing the measure.

somewhat different than normal and compete for the local share of the TV audience traditionally dominated by Ch. 2 during the morning hours. National news has been delayed until 8 or 9 a.m. because we are experiencing a really unexceptional snowfall. Are roads slick? Sure. Will accidents happen? Certainly, but accidents are just that, they happen. Unfortunately, accidents with severe or fatal injuries occur everyday, but we don't shut down national feeds in order to report every incident.

As a health care consultant working with many Maryland employers, I see first hand the changes that are already underway. You will not have the same health plans in 2014 as you have today, despite repeated promises by likes of Messrs. DeMarco and O'Malley and President Barack Obama. The changes for the nine out 10 Marylanders that get their health insurance from their employers will be profound!

Kentucky (-6) over Kansas: Though most championship games are entertaining, they are often unmemorable. There’s the occasional Butler half-court heave or Mario Chalmers 3-pointer, but eight of the past 12 title games have been decided by nine or more points. The Wildcats (37-2) are clearly the best team in the country, with a floor that isn’t very low and a ceiling that is historically high. With a win, they will become the first team to win a title with two or fewer losses since 1999.

"We are sorry for the unfortunate way we had to deliver the news on the telephone about an hour later to Coach Paterno. However, we saw no better alternative. Because Coach Paterno's home was surrounded by media representatives, photographers and others, we did not believe there was a dignified, private and secure way to send board representatives to meet with him there. Nor did we believe it would be wise to wait until the next morning, since we believed it was probable that Coach Paterno would hear the news beforehand from other sources, which would be inappropriate."

The area between the Dolores and San Miguel rivers once was a nuclear hub but has fallen on hard times.

Addai, who turned 29 on Thursday, has played six seasons in the league, all with Indianapolis, which drafted him in the first round (30th overall) out of LSU in 2006.

The fight had started, as Baker understood it, when Wallace sent Za'Zell to the grocery store to buy something. Za'Zell didn't have enough money, however, so she tried standing outside the store and asking strangers for spare change. Whether she was unsuccessful or simply had taken too long to return home, Baker doesn't know, but Wallace had been angry and had kicked out Za'Zell and the children in the rain.

Greenstein and Assemblymen DeAngelo and Benson. Our 1,600 members, families and friends will support the re-election of these candidates.

"I started playing quarterback my freshman year of high school after playing running back in eighth grade," said Lynch. "I always idolized quarterbacks. That's the only guy I watched on TV. When the coach tells you you can play it here, that's all I ever wanted to do."
Then we must address the money that it will bring in. I am told that it will bring in a half million dollars in fees immediately! That money alone might buy us a little time in making budget decisions regarding our police or the Resource Center, two areas of obvious concern to Pacificans. Then the property tax income will most definitely increase, the residents will be spending their money in Pacifica and their families who visit them will be spending their money in Pacifica, further increasing revenue for the city. It will create jobs. What is negative in that scenario?

More than a dozen Secret Service agents contacted by The Associated Press have abruptly hung up or declined to return multiple messages to discuss their agency and former coworkers.

I was destined to become a statistic: Black, male, poor, reared on the colder side of Chi-Town - where premature death by GSW (gunshot wound) sometimes seemed the lesser of the evils compared to becoming one of the living dead who staggered in hopelessness and despair.
Second, California is among a handful of states that granted retroactive benefit increases without funding them  the infamous SB 400 of 1999, authored by Sacramento Democrat Sen. Deborah Ortiz, co-authored by Anthony Pescetti, R-Sacramento, and Darrell Steinberg, D-Sacramento. It passed the Legislature with only seven no votes. That set California on a path to pension crisis.

I have no desire to rehash the arguments about why it's okay for Christians to love Harry Potter and the whole world of witchcraft and wizardry it represents. I could say: if you're offended by it, don't read it. I could write about the important values the stories champion, but good literature should never be reduced to moralistic bromide.
Security changes would take years, however. As late as 2005, the fences at some terminals were in shoddy condition, electronic warning systems were unreliable and electronic camera surveillance was spotty. Only in recent years has the Coast Guard given the port stellar ratings for its security.

As the economy improves and people worry less about being frugal, the risk is that retailers will get more complacent and not focus as much on their customers, he added.
For a certain kind of Catholic, this is anathema. They assume only one possible interpretation of Catholic social teaching: their own. So when a Republican House budget chairman dares suggest that his approach to taxes and spending also rests on a moral foundation, the cry goes up: Partisanship! Social Darwinism! War on the Poor!

Sometimes the bombs find their targets; sometimes they level a family home. In his fourth novel, James Meek, a former war correspondent, makes the well-worn point that unseen enemies can be demonized and thus easier to erase. But Meek adds a compelling level of intimacy by arguing that killing without truly knowing who you are killing is as dangerous as loving someone at arm's length, something his protagonist Adam is expert at.

Two years ago, it decided to spend an extra $35,000 a year to purchase catheters coated with drugs and other materials to ward off germs.

Fifty years ago, America was just waking up to the reality of environmental pollution: Rachel Carson had published Silent Spring, heralding the modern environmental movement and raising America's consciousness about the impact of DDT pesticide use on the environment and public health. Then, in 1969, Cleveland's Cuyahoga River caught fire due to the oil-soaked debris consuming it, and the country's then-largest oil spill occurred in Santa Barbara, California. The culmination of these events inspired the call for a national day promoting environmental education and lead to the creation of the first Earth Day on April 22, 1970.
Tensions were so high that when Jeffrey Kightlinger, now the general manager at Metropolitan, started with the agency in 1995 one of his first tasks was to see if San Diego County could be kicked out of the alliance of water districts.

Mladic, like Karadzic, is charged with masterminding the worst Serb atrocities of the Bosnian war, from ethnic cleansing campaigns early in the conflict to the deadly campaign of shelling and sniping during the siege of Sarajevo to the 1995 murder of 8,000 Muslim men and boys in Srebrenica, Europe's worst massacre since World War II.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has introduced a complicated plan that would truly call Mr. Obama's fundamental bluff: that the White House honestly favors a courageous "grand bargain" that would make serious and steep cuts to entitlements in exchange for "revenue" increases (i.e., tax hikes).
Paquin and Moyer, 42, recently announced that they are expecting their first child together. Moyer already has two children from a previous relationship - son Billy and daughter Lilac.
Yet "Marigold Hotel" is too well made to be dismissed and contains too much truth to be scorned. Based on a novel by Deborah Moggach, the screenplay takes a half-dozen stories and mingles them, and yet each character's through-line is effective on its own. There's Tom Wilkinson, quite moving as a man who returns to India after 40 years to seek out the lover of his youth. There's Judi Dench - truly lovely and completely open here - as a grieving widow with money troubles. And Maggie Smith, as a former maid (with the demeanor of a duchess) recovering from a hip replacement.
Weber's ruling means the lawyers will have to pick a new panel if the case goes to trial. She ordered them back to court Wednesday morning to discuss how the case should proceed.
The prolific tweeter gave a bit more insight about the elbow later that night.
As dusk deepens, and an evening chill begins to set in, we coax a fire to life, and I learn something new about camp cooking. I usually eat freeze-dried meals when camping. They're lightweight and easy to fix. Just add boiling water to the bag and let it cook in its pouch for 10 minutes. The taste - well, the food is hot. And did I mention how easy they are to fix?

Food on the Memphis-to-Henderson leg was good to excellent, with Natchez-born chef Regina Charboneau offering a menu heavy on fresh Southern fare. Breakfast and lunch are buffet-style; 24-hour snack service is available in a section of the boat called Front Porch of America, complete with rocking chairs and bench swings. Highlights were a New Orleans-style jazz brunch with shrimp, grits and crab cake eggs benedict, a three-course dinner featuring duck breast with orange-currant sauce and dessert beignets, and excellent beef brisket po' boys served at an outdoor bar-restaurant called the River Grill.
So how does HB 1280 try to maneuver around this obstacle? It blithely declares a "video lottery terminal" is not "a machine or device defined as a slot machine" in the constitution. Yet as bold as that claim might be, it is also illegitimate.
Gibbs' arrival may signal the reopening of the pipeline from Seton Hall Prep to Seton Hall — one that had been responsible for the last period of Pirate NCAA Tournament success almost a decade ago.

Johnson, the NFL's leading rusher, set a couple of franchise records. His 17-yard run at the end of the first half pushed him past Hall of Fame running back Earl Campbell's mark of 1,981 yards from scrimmage in 1980. Johnson also has the team mark to himself with eight straight 100-yard rushing games.

I think the answer has to do with the fact that with most diets you're always hungry. And what's worse, when you do finally get to eat something, it's rarely something you enjoy eating. There's all that delicious food out there, and what do you end up with? A celery stalk and some brown rice. Washed down with some green tea. Blech!

And it all adds up to a classic bullying scene. Your brother-in-law is the bully, your sister-in-law is his validation -- mean people generally think they're justified, not mean -- your husband is the victim, their parents and other relatives are the under-outraged bystanders (perhaps with their own agendas), and you're the one watching it all and saying, "Um, isn't anyone going to do anything?"

"In our backyard in the peak of summer, there are 300,000 bees in our hives. We hardly see them. Bees are busy collecting nectar and pollen. The only complaint came from one neighbor who wanted to see more of them in her yard," said John. Replacing a 35-year skydiving hobby, he planted his feet firmly in beekeeping. Five years ago he asked his wife, a Master Gardener, why he saw no honeybees in her gardens. The honeybee's dramatic decline of recent decades piqued their interest. "The next thing I knew we were buying hives and honeybees," he said.

Pearl's Deluxe Burgers in San Francisco's Tenderloin makes a convincing case for sliding back into old eating habits. Save for the dulcet lavender stucco walls, the tiny space has no decor to speak of.

I was very pleased to see Baltimore restaurants represented within the grounds. Dave Rather of Mother's Federal Hill Grille deserves credit for corralling his neighboring restaurants on the south side, which were effectively marooned by the race's layout.

There were good showings by Ryleigh's Oyster, Jimmy's Famous Seafood, Cazbar, South Beach Sandwicherie in the Budweiser Block Party on Turn 4.
Yet the meter, with its hinged metal lid, clock-like face and sturdy construction, is an impressive mechanism. It might look good for its age, and some have seen the other side of 30, but being old is a problem. Even when they still work — accurately measuring the flow of water that moves through them — they require tending. Someone has to loosen that lid nut, scare off those bugs, sometimes pump out ground water, then read the settings on the dial.
After seemingly months of watching theatrical trailers promoting “Dolphin Tale,” I certainly expected more sap than strength from this story of the rescued title animal being aided immensely by a mechanical tail.
Deasy outlined the allegations in an April 13 letter to the school. The Board of Education is scheduled to vote May 1 on whether to take the first step to revoke Birmingham's charter. Officials could not recall a similar action against a school that became an independent charter.

David West Read's delicate new drama, "The Dream of the Burning Boy," makes its points gently. Too gently, perhaps -- the play feels slight, even if the cast hits precisely modulated grace notes.
The other kind is the one that speaks to a desire for rudimentary dance-floor schlock — the kind of schlock intense enough to batter down national and cultural barriers. Few were willing to defend "Macarena" when it was sweeping the globe, but radio stations couldn’t stop playing it, and pop fans couldn’t stop dancing to it. These songs are, simultaneously, runaway chart successes and cultural jokes. Even as we’re doing the steps, we recognize that there’s something slightly embarrassing about the way we fell for the big beat. It speaks to the collective frailty of the human psyche, and how easily manipulated it is.
Ventura is long on patience, short on "foofery." His pregame meeting with media lasted about seven minutes, about half of Ozzie Guillen's typical on-the-record chats that usually dragged on after the notepads and microphones had been put away.

The speckled, shield-shaped bugs crawl through cracks in window frames, vents or foundations, then send out an aggregation pheromone, not the same chemical that gives the bug its name, to attract others.
Nor should you have been reticent. It would be insulting to assume that someone that close for that long would think only of herself and not be happy for you. But at the same time, your roommate needs to make plans, and to do that, she needs to know when you are changing your living arrangements. Now is the time to tell her that.

John Stauffer's "Giants," a parallel biography of Lincoln and Frederick Douglass, is an original, eloquent, unsentimental examination of both men and their legacies. Stauffer is cold-eyed about his subjects, particularly Lincoln. He paints a scene in the White House in the fall of 1861, when Jessie Fremont -- daughter of Sen. Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri and wife of John C. Fremont, the Union officer who unilaterally issued his own emancipation proclamation in 1861 (thus freeing the slaves of Confederate sympathizers in Missouri) -- came to see Lincoln, who pointedly did not ask her to sit down.

We were reminded of the former all night. Whether it was lighting up a blunt thrown to him during “Roll One Up” or his ear-to-ear smile after a leopard bra landed on stage (“Our first!” he yelled), there was no question whether or not Rocky exudes the star-power many up-and-coming rappers lack live. He commands a crowd in a likeable way — think the opposite of an entitled diva — making his entire set feel like an inclusive party. When he ran out of songs (he only has one album and a couple stray songs), he announced he was "not done partying with y’all.” So his DJ played rap classics — Juvenile’s “Ha,” Big Tymers’ “Still Fly” and most appropriately his hometown heroes The Diplomats' “Dipset Anthem” — while Rocky and his buddies drank 40s, puffed strong and danced. The “Peso” video had come to life.

What I would do if I could do something else: Fire investigator. I have handled numerous fire cases over the years and have even passed the test to become a certified fire and explosion investigator.

"Ratko Mladic deserves to be tried and convicted. He was the military commander who ordered the murder of thousands and attempted to destroy Bosnian society. His trial should teach again the grim reality of ethnic cleansing and, I hope, bring some comfort to those who survived. ... Mladic tried to become a conquering hero.

A: That's one of the things you play the game for, having a chance to play for a championship. That's what all 32 teams every year, you've got 1,900 guys trying to get to the same place.

STEVE: I'll take a wild guess here and assume the reason you want to ask that question is to make sure he genuinely cares for you and isn't just trying to seduce you. The problem is that -- if he is like most men -- he will give you an answer designed to seduce you. So you're back where you started. You're gonna have to use your own judgment on this one.

Apologies for the comment were forthcoming, and rightly so. Certainly raising five boys must be considered "working." A chorus of mothers would testify that raising children is hard, stressful, but joyful work that can send you crawling to the pillow, dead to the world by day's end.

As much as I like Artisan, I am won over by Villa Creek. The combinations are precocious and explosive, such as the local sea bass with a preserved lemon and red onion crème fraîche.
